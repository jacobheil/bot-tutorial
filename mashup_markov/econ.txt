This Independent Study seeks to understand how to improve the durability of peace in the aftermath of intrastate wars. Specifically, I research the role of implementation in achieving durable peace after the signing of negotiated settlements. Based upon a review of the literature, I begin to develop the argument that implementation is a distinct variable in peace processes. Utilizing a most similar systems comparative case study design I test my hypothesis that comprehensive implementation of negotiated settlements leads to durable peace. I offer process tracing case narratives of the peace processes resulting from the intrastate wars in Tajikistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia. I conclude that comprehensive implementation does lead to durable peace. My research also suggests that peacekeepers might be able to preserve an otherwise unimplemented peace. My Independent Study provides a greater understanding of the often overlooked role implementation plays in achieving durable peace.
This independent study project examines the effects of Structural Adjustment Policies of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on political participation in three Central American States. Based on the literature regarding the effects of Structural Adjustment Policies, political trust in government, and types of political participation, I expect to observe increases in non-institutionalized participation and decreases in non-institutionalized participation following the introduction of Structural Adjustment Policies. After a three country case study analysis I find that my hypothesis is not supported. There is no relationship between Structural Adjustment and political participation. What possible effects Structural Adjustment may have on political participation are overshadowed by other variables such as levels of repression and security concerns. This is important for criticisms of conditional lending policies and the continued effectiveness of using economic liberalization to promote political liberalization.
This study addresses the impact that proper implementation of Core Labor Standards (CLS) has on economic growth. The theoretical findings lend support to the hypothesis that proper implementation of CLS increases efficiency of workers as well as investment in human capital, and thus has positive implications for economic growth. Additionally, this study questions the validity of variables and methods chosen by other authors examining similar questions and attempts to create a new measure of CLS implementation accounting for ratification of the relevant International Labor Organization (ILO) conventions as well as the political environment of the country. Using a fixed-effects model with panel data for three samples of countries from 1990-2008, empirical evidence is presented that suggests that higher levels of CLS in a country lead to higher GDP per-capita. It is encouraged that the findings presented here be utilized by Non-Govermental Organizations attempting to persuade governments to adopt and enforce the eight conventions pertaining to CLS.
Foreign policies designed with the intention of protecting domestic interests often have unintended consequences for foreign countries or groups of people.  Since the early 1980s the United States has been waging a War on Drugs in Latin America that has not only failed to diminish the production and flow of drugs but has also resulted in a variety of unintended negative consequences for Latin Americans. In South America, indigenous groups in the Andes have been growing coca leaves, the plant from which cocaine is derived, for cultural and religious purposes for centuries.  The leaves are chewed together by friends and family members in a symbolic gesture of community and reciprocity.  When consumed in their raw form, coca leaves are not a harmful narcotic and do not cause health problems.  Only when processed with certain chemicals does coca become an addictive and dangerous drug.  Indigenous South Americans have historically been impoverished, largely as a result of ethnic discrimination.  But when the tin mining industry, where most indigenous people in the Andes had worked since colonization, collapsed in the 1970s, this poverty became more extreme.  Many reacted by increasing their coca cultivation and selling the leaves to drug traffickers, and today many indigenous South Americans are dependent on the drug trade for their livelihoods.  The United States' War on Drugs has focused its efforts on destroying the coca crops of South Americans.  This study contends that this policy decision has negatively and disproportionately affected indigenous South Americans in three ways.  First, it has disproportionately decreased the economic status of indigenous people by threatening their only available source of income.  Additionally, it has made public perceptions of the coca leaf more negative and exacerbated discrimination against indigenous people who grow it.  Lastly, it has forced many indigenous South Americans to abandon growing and chewing a plant that is central to their culture and identity, thereby contributing to the erosion of ancient indigenous cultures.
The United States government spends billions of dollars every year to combat the trafficking and consumption of illegal narcotics, yet continues to face mixed acceptance of its policy from other countries involved in the drug industry.  Through this Independent Study, I sought to determine why these host countries accept or reject United States Drug Policy.  Specifically, I determined the impact of both the amount of pressure that the United States applies, and of the host country's domestic bases of political support.  Based upon a review of the literature, I developed the argument that international pressure does play a role on acceptance of U.S. Drug Policy, but conditional to the host country's domestic bases of political support.  I tested my hypothesis using a most similar systems comparative case study design.  Taking into account all controlled variables, I selected Costa Rica, Panama, and Guatemala in the 1980s as my cases.  I concluded that the variables do indeed interact as my hypothesis suggested: the governments of host countries accept or reject U.S. policy conditional to domestic bases of political support, and only then will international pressure play a major role in policy adoption.  My Independent Study provides a more complete understanding of the conditions in which host countries will accept United States Drug Policy.
This study theoretically and empirically examines the impact of political institutions and market structure on economic growth, particularly in resource-rich countries.
The first decade of the 21st century has seen China and India reach unprecedented levels of economic growth. To fuel their burgeoning economies, China and India are increasingly looking to Africa where the recent discovery of oil resources has spurred major foreign investment by the two superpowers. Comparatively, however, Chinese efforts to enter the oil industry in Africa have been more successful than India's. My research question, then, is: Which factors explain the differential success of China and India in entering the African oil industry? I argue that differential success is due to differences in the Chinese and Indian domestic political systems. More specifically, I hypothesize that Chinese entry efforts have been comparatively more successful due to differences in the following factors: (1) motives of entry (security vs. profit considerations) and (2) perceptions of China and India among African states. As a topic of interest and relevance for multiple academic fields, my research draws different elements from fields such as political science, economics, and international business.
This IS examines Bulgaria's integration policies for refugees, 1993-2010. It assesses the legislation as well as the ways in which policies have been implemented. In addition, it aims to present the main obstacles that refugees encounter in their integration into Bulgarian society.
This study attempts to theoretically and empirically analyze the incorporation of gendered variables into the Solow growth model. Based upon the fundamental form of the Solow model, as well as relevant literature, a theoretical model is constructed that integrates two gendered variables. Specifically female human capital, and female labor force participation are included in the model to test if gender has an impact on economic growth. It is hypothesized that these variables will have a positive effect on per capita as well as total output. This hypothesis is tested empirically using panel data from 13 MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries for the years 1995 through 2005. The statistical analysis does not support the hypothesis, however this study finds that increased gender equality, specifically through the promotion of women's economic opportunities, does have a positive effect economic growth.
This independent study will examine the effectiveness of interfaith dialogue as a peacebuilding tool in post-conflict settings. Initially, International Relations as a discipline virtually ignored religion and its influence. Instead, it presumed that the world would move towards a state of complete secularism. Beginning in the latter part of the twentieth century, scholars have begun to examine how religion can be incorporated not only into International Relations theory, but also more practically in a wide variety of global interactions. Interfaith dialogue is but one way in which religion can be integrated into the peacebuilding process in a society that has experienced violent conflict. Using a comparative case study method, I examine interfaith dialogue in the peacebuilding processes of Bosnia-Herzegovina, El Salvador, and Lebanon. Because research on the application of interfaith dialogue is still in its early stages, this study focuses on gathering information, and identifying patterns and trends so that more concrete hypotheses can be constructed and tested in future research.
This Independent Study examines the role of the international community in either promoting or hindering the cause of anti-corruption in sub-Saharan Africa. Corruption and anticorruption have come to occupy an increasingly large segment of the international governance discourse and it has become common for donor agencies, foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations to incorporate corruption related policy prescriptions into poverty reduction strategies and aid packages. This has been especially true of sub-Saharan Africa, where externally-driven anti-corruption policies have at points been criticized for violating the principle of sovereignty and at other points been denounced as the face of Western neo-imperialism. Given their high cost and the controversy they have generated, are externallydriven anti-corruption policies a worthwhile endeavor, or are African states better tackling the problem of corruption on their own? This study seeks to answer that question by comparing three African states: South Africa, Nigeria and Mozambique to determine whether or not externallydriven anti-corruption policies are more or less likely to succeed than internally-driven policies. South Africa represents a country with a high number of donor-initiated anti-corruption projects while Nigeria represents a country with a low number. Mozambique is situated between these two countries in order to more rigorously test this study’s theoretical argument.
Many theories have emerged since the 1970s to explain the rapid emergence and dominance of Kenya's Kalenjin ethnic group in the sport of professional distance running. This one group of people hailing from the Rift Valley has reigned supreme from every distance over 800 meters for close to 50 years. This study disassociates the group's success from genetic and geographical theories and describes how the Kalenjin society's cultural perception of the importance of "masculinity" in their men has fueled this distance running dominance. Using secondary sources on the culture, history and success of the Kalenjin as well as interviews with various members of the ethnic group residing in Iten, Kenya, this paper proves how engrained cultural elements fueled the Kalenjin men's move toward professional running and their success. The Kalenjin men who now serve as some of the top runners in the world all exhibit the same urge to prove their "masculinity" or "manliness." Beyond genetics or their high altitude training, this culturally embedded urge is what has primarily created what many call the "Kenyan Running Revolution." The use of oral histories and secondary sources provide depth to our understanding of this remarkable athletic talent. This project will contribute further to the study of Kalenjin running as well as to the general study of athletic talent.
This paper examines whether or not the inclusions of the two variables threat and a country's level of wealth augment the negative relationship between military expenditure and economic growth.  These variables are added based upon assumptions made in the realist paradigm, found in International Relations theory, that security is the primary objective of a state and that security is measured through power.  The predicted impacts of these variables are modeled based upon an augmented Slow Growth model.  After a discussion of the theory and a review of the literature on this topic, the model used in this thesis is specified and then tested empirically.
This thesis seeks to address both the evolution of international sovereignty norms and the process of state-level internalization of these norms by working across international relations theories. It poses the following, two-part, research question: have international legal sovereignty norms evolved, and if so, by what process have states internalized new sovereignty norms on the domestic level? It hypothesizes that traditional constructs of Westphalian sovereignty have evolved into a new sovereignty-modern norm, which is characterized by the emergence of positive rights in international law. It further hypothesizes that international norms frame domestic level cost-benefit analysis on the state level, which leads to domestic level internalization or rejection of these new norms in domestic law.  It tests this theory through the use of a comparative case methodology, which encompasses two series of quantitative content analysis and a series of textual analysis of state-level cost-benefit decision-making. It concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings of this study.
This paper looks at the relationship between human rights organization naming practices and the allocation of United States Military Assistance from 1991 to 2009. By using both realist and social constructivist international relations theories the paper statistically analyzes the variables in question on both a global and region by region basis. Results show that higher levels of HRO naming are correlated with higher amounts of United States Military Assistance. This correlation was shown to be strongest in the regions of Central America, South America, and Africa. The correlation also appears to be limited to time period after the year 2000.
This independent study attempts to examine the deeper impacts of international environmental agreements through investigation of the impact of international environmental agreements have on human development. Although the research in this field is very minimal, this study attempts to add to this area of study through a quantitative analysis of the impacts of the agreement that is often deemed the most successful international environmental agreement, the Montreal Protocol. The results of the analysis suggest that the ratification of an international environmental agreement has no impact on human welfare.
Events such as the Madrid 2004 train bombings, the 2005 London bombings, and the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood Army base have many states in the West beginning to see homegrown terrorism as being as much of a threat as international terrorism, if not more so. This study aims to analyze policies that Western states have developed in order to address the homegrown terror threat. The cases of the United States and United Kingdom are used to explore how factors such as the understanding of radicalization and perception of threat impact the development and scope of counter-homegrown terror policies. Results of this case study indicate that a common understanding of radicalization may exist, leading to policies with similar objectives, and that the perception of the homegrown terror threat appears to influence the speed in which a policy is developed.
This study seeks to determine if multinational corporations attempt influence the outcome of international negotiations. In order to examine this, I conducted two case studies pertaining to international trade negotiations between the United States and the European Union. The results from my analysis indicate multinational corporations do attempt to influence international negotiation outcomes through various methods.
This study examines the role of Confucian culture at the government and societal levels in influence educational success. A comparative case study is conducted of Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China to adress this at both the government and societal levels. The hypothesis that culture matters in influencing educational outcomes is supported by the data.
In recent years, the international community has seen the Internet ascend to prominence in transforming the way people communicate, organize, and achieve common goals.  From an International Relations perspective, do we see the Internet as a tool used for principled good or as a weapon for the wicked?  This study examines the implications of Internet repression on the emergence of human rights issues held dear by transnational advocacy networks (TAN) through a comparative case study of Egypt and Syria and a content analysis of Newsweek articles from 1980-2012.  This study hypothesized lower levels of Internet repression would lead to greater success of human rights issue emergence.  Consequently, the inverse is expected for higher levels of Internet repression.  Using the number of Newsweek articles per country-year as a gauge of international discussion, issue emergence was indirectly measured.  Ultimately, within the limits of this study the hypothesis is proven correct.  Egypt, with lower levels of Internet repression than Syria, had a greater number of articles published regarding human rights abuses, whereas Syria had fewer.  Thus, the greater Internet freedom a country has, the more success human rights issues have galvanizing on the international stage, ultimately gaining the attention of the relevant TANs.  If identical or similar results are found in future tests of this nature, the implications of this information could be vast.  Such implications could include helping preempt human rights abuses by incorporating information and communication technologies such as the Internet into aid projects in developing nations.  Furthermore, TANs could use the Internet as a tool to expand their capabilities in promoting and campaigning for issues, leading to potentially huge gains in the fight for human rights across the world.
International election monitoring is a phenomenon that began to spread rapidly in the 1990s and has since become an essential element of elections in the developing world. This study assesses the relationship between the presence of international election monitors during presidential elections and levels of voters' confidence in the electoral process. Several questions guide the study: How did the norm of international election monitoring develop and how widely do governments adhere to this norm? Are citizens more confident in the efficacy and transparency of presidential elections when international monitors are present? I hypothesize that when governments adhere to the norm of international election monitoring by inviting international observers, citizens will have higher levels of confidence in the electoral process. I conduct a comparative case study examining the presidential elections in Benin, Mali, and Guinea between 1990 and 2011. Using election monitors' reports, literature surrounding each of the elections, and public opinion survey data reflecting citizens' perceptions of the elections and democracy in their countries, I test the relationship between the two variables in my model. The findings suggest that a positive correlation between the variables is likely. However, because no data currently exists that directly measures the impacts of international election monitors, the study ultimately concludes that further research must be done to confirm the positive relationship between international monitors' presence and voters' confidence levels.
This Independent Study examines the relationship of democratic institutions and sound domestic policy implementation on the economic growth in developing resource dependent countries. Developing countries that have natural resource abundance are given an economic sector that should allow them a step up on other developing countries. However, history has proven that countries that have natural resource abundance tend to do worse off economically, this has been commonly called the "resource curse". This study attempts to solve the puzzle of the "resource curse" and find the root of the problem. Critiques on the resource curse suggest multiple cures for the curse including sound domestic policies. Given that the resource curse still exists, do democratic institutions encourage the implementation of sound domestic policies leading to economic growth? Democratic institutions provide checks and balance and transparency for countries that have natural resources, this provides an opportunity for countries to implement sound domestic policies in order to ensure prudent fiscal policies to allocate resource rents responsibly. This study implements a comparative case study, examining the cases of Nigeria and Botswana. Nigeria demonstrates a case that has low levels of democratic institutions, and Botswana demonstrates a case that has higher levels of democratic institutions.
Many policymakers and academics have argued that harsh military strategies are counterproductive in the fight against terrorist forces.  Using the behavioral economic constructs of the Dove-Hawk game and Monitoring theory, this paper strives to prove that cooperative strategies have the potential to improve results for both the government and the terrorist organization.  Monitoring theory makes the theoretical claim that the firm and the employee can gain through mutual capitulation and increased exchanges of wages for effort.  Similarly, this paper argues that both the government and the domestic terrorist organization can gain by utilizing more cooperative, incentive based policies, and less militaristic strategies.  The thesis concludes with an empirical test of the model's hypotheses using panel data on domestic terrorist attacks in 112 countries over the years of 1997 to 2009.
This paper focuses on the philosophy of development from an economic view and a more philosophical view. The economic theory of development will be explicated within the neoclassical framework. Neoclassical economics has been the leading theory used within the context of development and focuses on raising the GDP per capita. The proposed philosophical view of development shall be Amartya Sen's capability theory based on increasing the freedom of an individual. Chapters 2 will develop the foundations of neoclassical economics. From that foundation, microeconomic theory will be developed as development on the microeconomic level within neoclassical theory. Then the argument for the theory of neoclassical development will be explained. Chapter 3 will critique the means and ends of the neoclassical theory of economic development. Chapter 4 will focus on Sen's theory, development as freedom. Within this chapter, it will shown how Sen's conception of development differs from the previous theory as his theory is based on freedoms and not solely income levels. After Sen's means and ends have been explicated, they will also be critiqued. The sixth chapter will begin to lay the foundation for a normative theory of development. This foundation consists of three claims of development that are taken from the downfalls of the previous two theories. These three claims are concerned with the proper means, the proper ends and the place of culture within development. The final chapter shall address four kinds of claims concerning values within the context of development. These four kinds of claims are analyzed showing that the mistakes of the neoclassical and capability theory are made because these theories confuse these four kinds of claims together. With this analysis, the four kinds of value claims will be discussed within the context of a normative theory for development.
Previous researchers interested in studying the risk of acquisition have approached the topic from either a cost inefficiency or agency cost perspective. This paper develops a theoretical model that combines cost inefficiency with agency costs to explain how management inefficiency negatively impacts firms in a Cournot quantity competition analysis. These theories are then used to explain why some firms survive the market for corporate control and others do not. Utilizing a binomial logit model, the empirical results support the agency cost hypothesis, whereby firms with less executive ownership are more likely to be taken over. However, the results do not support the cost inefficiency hypothesis that firms with greater cost inefficiencies are more likely to be taken over. These results appear robust over a multiple number of model specifications and the approach of considering both factors in the risk of takeover is promoted for future research.
A philosophical critique given of the Neoclassical assumption of utility maximization suggests that utility is an inadequate theory of well-being. An outline of the fundamental assumptions in Neoclassical economic theory is given as well as a detailed look into the utility model. Next, an outline of Institutional economics is presented as well as its attack on the assumption of utility maximization. Institutional economists believe that wellbeing is constituted by objective needs that are universalizable. It is then argued that Neoclassical economists uses utility in reference to either two theories: a pleasure theory or a preference theory. Argumentation shows that neither the pleasure nor the preference theory are adequate theories of well-being. The author proposes that there are two necessary and sufficient conditions of an adequate theory of well-being: non-instrumental values and the appreciation of non-instrumental values. The Platts-McDowell objective list theory is presented as an alternative theory of well-being. The theory holds that wellbeing is constituted by desirable characteristics intrinsic in activities and experiences, and for those characteristics to mean anything to the individual he must first appreciate those non-instrumental values. In an attempt to reconcile the philosophical theory with economics, an alternative theory of well-being is given to be used in Neoclassical economics. The alternative theory uses indices that represent non-instrumental capabilities that constitute well-being.
Child health is an important quality in the life and development of a child. A mother serves as a primary caregiver for a child and a mother's decision about time allocation between the labor force and the household may be influential in child health. Data from the 1994 National Longitudinal Survey is used in this research to explore the influence of maternal employment on the number of illnesses requiring medical attention for children aged 12 to 72 months. Estimates from Ordinary Least Square regressions are obtained for four models. Estimated regression models indicate that maternal employment has no significant impact on the measure of child health. No difference in the number of illnesses requiring medical attention exists for children of mothers who work and children of mothers who do not work.
Lately, there has been a heated debate over the subsidy programs of the United States government towards its domestic cotton sector. Over the past two decades, the U.S. has grown into a dominating power in the international cotton trade despite having some of the highest costs of production for cotton. Due to an increasing amount of U.S. cotton subsidies over the years, American cotton producers have deflated the price of cotton by nearly 65% since 1990. This has resulted in welfare losses for cotton farmers in the developing world, market competitors who originally had a comparative advantage in cotton production regarding land endowments and cheap labor. Due to the resilience of the U.S. agricultural subsidy programs, despite the World Trade Organization's efforts to re-level the playing field in the cotton trade, some cotton farmers in the developing world have had to seek other avenues for income generation. This study is one of few to econometrically look at the effects U.S. cotton subsidies have on cotton producing households in the developing world, as well as the use of income diversification amongst some of these households to try and escape the poverty trap. Following the construction of a theoretical framework consisting of the agricultural household model, a 2SLS specification is employed on IFPRI's Pakistan Panel Survey. The data covers the years 1986-1990, and is used to analyze the impacts of U.S. cotton subsidies on 66 cotton producing households in Pakistan's Punjab province as well as income diversification as a mode of income smoothing. The regression results produce mixed findings.
This paper estimates the quantitative factors that lead to a growth in the US consumption of Chinese textiles after the global quota liberalization in 2005. The theoretical frameworks show that quotas should be thoroughly liberalized to benefit US consumers and the approach of free trade brings in national welfare gains to the US. The theories consider the following scenarios: (i) free trade; (ii) trade diversion of NAFTA; and (iii) function of market share. Utilizing panel data of HTS codes at the 6-digit levels from 1994 to 2007, the author employed three double log models with eight model specifications on each model to measure the determinants of the market shares of Chinese textiles in the US total textile imports. The empirical results suggest that US consumption of Chinese textiles rose from the ATC period to the Safeguard years majorly due to reductions in the prices of Chinese textiles. Aware of the centrality of the price determinants, the price measure of Mexican textiles under the protections of NAFTA and the income factor are also significant.
Is athletics a wage-enhancing activity? Utilizing the human capital and signaling theories, this study hypothesizes that athletics is a wage-enhancing activity. An econometric analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Education Study of 1988 provides significant empirical evidence to support this hypothesis, yet finds little evidence to support the hypothesis that the wage premium is different across various occupations. This study implements both the Ordinary Least Squares and Two-stage Least Squares regression techniques to estimate the impact of athletic participation on future wages. The study also finds evidence that the wage impacts of participation in individual and team sports are indistinguishable. This disaggregated examination of the impact of athletic participation on wage expands on the previous literature and provides a new area of the research for future studies to analyze.
An estimated 158 million children aged 5-14 are engaged in child labor which translates to one in six children in the world (Unicef, 2010). Millions of children are engaged in hazardous situations or conditions, such as working in mines, working with chemicals and pesticides in agriculture, or working with dangerous machinery. Children are toiling as domestic servants in homes, laboring behind the walls of workshops, hidden from view in plantations (Unicef, 2010). The reason behind child labor is poverty and lack of resources in the household, which leads to parents choosing not to invest in the education of their child. A potential factor influencing the decision to put child in a labor market is the birth-order of the child.  This paper presents a theoretical framework by looking at the decision of poor-households to invest in the education of their children or put them into the labor force. The human capital model will be used to explain the decision process of the household. It then uses data from India for the empirical analysis. The ordinal logistic regression model is used to test if birth-order effects have a negative impact on the activity of the child. The results in the paper confirm that birth-order effects can play a key role when a household is deciding the future activity of their child.
This research paper asks the question, how does a liberal arts degree versus a state university degree affect wages for post-graduates seeking employment in the labor market? After graduating and entrance into the labor force, state university graduates receive a higher starting salary due to specific human capital attainment. Over time, liberal arts college graduates receive a higher salary because of a more broad human capital acquired through formal education. Data was collected from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth starting in 1997 (NLSY97) pertaining to demographics and labor market experiences. Various factors are attributed to the changes in earnings such as gender, race, occupation, industry, citizenship, US geographical location of residents, and whether the individual attended a liberal arts college or state university. Results indicated that state university graduates received a higher starting wage, but as time progressed, the salary gap between liberal arts college graduates and state university graduates diminished.
This study analyzed the impact of tariffs on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Vertical FDI arise due to wage differential between the home and the host country. An increase in tariffs is likely to deter vertical FDI. Horizontal FDI is motivated by tariff- jumping. Higher tariffs set by governments of foreign countries are likely to increase trade costs and motivates a firm to undertake horizontal foreign production to avoid paying tariffs. Thus higher tariffs attract horizontal FDI. The total impact of tariffs on FDI is partially dependent on the relative importance of the two types FDI. We hypothesized tariffs are negatively related to FDI. We apply industrial data and empirically test the hypothesis. We found tariffs are positively related to FDI, although this result is not significant.
What theoretical and empirical validity exists, if any, for the hypothesis that international trade reduces the incidence of international conflict or similarly that it fosters peaceful international relations? This study argues that trade reduces conflict between states due to states' aversion to losing the utility gained from trade. States are better off trading than not trading at all, even if the ensuing interdependence makes them more vulnerable. States that trade gain higher utility than those that do not. The issue of breaking trade has devastating effects on states' utility. In a conflict scenario, when choosing between war or resolve, states are better off by choosing the latter option. Empirical results using a logistical random-effects model reveal that the relationship between interdependence and conflict are insignificant, opposite of many other findings in the literature. Furthermore, the results may be insignificant because of modeling weaknesses. Surprisingly, the literature fails to be a strong guide of regression models using fixed effects or random effects. The lack thereof suggests that future studies produce improved models that can more properly use random effects to test for this relationship. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the issue is predominantly studied by International Relations scholars, but not by economists. This paper serves as call to harmonize the two fields in regards to this issue as it concerns both economists and International Relations scholars alike.
This paper is devoted to examine the relationship between foreign direct investment (FDI) and wage inequality of skilled labor and unskilled labor in China. A theoretical framework that is developed based on the North-South trade model in Feenstra and Hanson (1997) suggests that, in the short run, foreign capital inflows in China will introduce new production methods that employ a higher ratio of skilled to unskilled labor in production activities. As a result, an aggregate labor demand is created because of such capital flows in the Chinese market. In particular, skilled labor will benefit more from FDI than unskilled labor in the short run, since a Leontief production function is used in the theory, where each type of production activities created by FDI employs a fixed ratio of skilled to unskilled labor. A panel setting consisting 25 Chinese provinces over the period from 1994 to 2003 is used to empirically test how FDI affects wage inequality. Results confirm that FDI increases the relative wage of skilled labor. In addition, test results also suggest there is significant evidence of state own enterprises (SOEs) and urban collectives (UCs) equalizing wages of skilled labor and unskilled labor. However, such an effect disappears in a fixed effects model with first differences.
Firms make decisions on a daily basis in order to determine the course of their daily operations. Their decisions demonstrate how effectively a firm can meet its bottom line given their constraints. One key element that significantly affects the nature of decision-making is how firms choose to define their bottom line. Most firms, more specifically, Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) tend to have a social and a financial bottom line. This can be explained by the fact the MFIs exist in order to provide financial services to the unbankable population around the world. Economists propose a standard theory of rationality that is based on root assumptions to explain decision-making with respect to utility. The alternative theory of rationality, which contradicts standard optimizing, is a theory based on pluralist satisficing. Accordingly, it supports the notion that MFIs ought to use sufficient means in order to attain enough of the multiple ends of an MFI. With multiple ends, we can establish the distinction between instrumental and non-instrumental values. With two types of values, the alternative theory of satisficing supports the existence of the plurality of values. Pluralism lends the ends to the possibility of incommensurability and indeterminacy, which also determines whether the ends of MFIs are competing.m By examining and analyzing the two theories of rationality, I will use considerations of the nature of an MFI to determine which theory better understands the rational decision-making of MFIs. One of the main considerations that have to be made is the extent to which the analysis of rationality of an MFI changes between the different theories of rationality.
While extensive economic research has been done on the traditional family consisting of a married different-sex couple and their children, new models of the family are now beginning to be explored. Same-sex and different-sex couples face different constraints that lead to dissimilar explicit/implicit cost benefit analysis for each type of family, which leads to same-sex and different-sex couples making different decisions. Four economic decisions are explored using an approach similar to Gary Becker's analysis of the family in Treatise on the Family: 1) the decision to commit, 2) how to define the relationship, 3) how to specialize within the household, and 4) the choice to have children. Models using data from the 2010 March Supplement of the U.S. Census support the conclusion that same-sex couples will have fewer children than different-sex couples based on disparate legal rights and biological constraints. Also, empirical testing shows that couple type plays a significant role in the decision to expand their family by having children.
The Porter Hypothesis has been extensively debated in recent decades due to an influx in environmental regulation. This study aims to explain the Porter Hypothesis from a theoretical perspective, and to analyze it using an empirical OLS approach. The data compiled is firm- specific and studies firms from across different industries. The study uses Tobin's Q as the dependent variable in order to measure firm performance. Using the environmental performance track as a proxy for innovation, the results of this study have found that firms that abide, enforce, or even surpass the needs of environmental regulation tend to increase their profits on the long run.
Plagued by unpredictable weather conditions and fluctuating markets, farming in developing countries is a risky occupation. While farmers save to smoothen consumption and take agro loans to reap higher farming income, they rarely have access to formal savings mechanism that provides interest. Having access to formal savings that provide interest while engaging in agro production backed by a micro loan would allow farming households to diversify their household economic portfolios to enjoy a higher level of consumption that not only will smoothen day to day financial constraints but also provide better contingencies against external shocks. This study examines the impact of having access to formal savings and loan programs on the level of consumption of farming households by considering savings and loan backed agro production as assets whose returns are maximized when held together in a portfolio.
This paper examines the effects of production costs due to digitalization on profit in the online music market.  This study empirically examines a sample of concert data, music descriptors, and music popularity charts that were completed in the period from January 2006 through December 2010.  The analysis is performed on subsamples stratified according to gross concert revenue.  The empirical results reveal basic evidence that the digitalization of production effects profit for firms in the online music market.  The basic findings support that music distributed through the internet, and internet popularity, do correlate to concert revenue.  However, this conclusion is based off of a relatively small sample set of years and without a total free market scope.  This study finds empirical evidence to support that internet popularity has a positive correlation to concert revenue.
In the biggest economic downturn since the Great Depression, the financial collapse of 2007 was a result of many economic factors. In particular, risky mortgage lending has been widely deemed the root cause of the financial crisis. In this research, borrower-lender and investor lender relationships are investigated using the Principal Agent Theory. It is hypothesized that a drastic increase in loan originations combined with deteriorating lending standards caused the eventual failure across the financial industry. Upon statistical analysis, this study provides evidence supporting the hypothesis based on data measured across one hundred metropolitan areas in 2010.
The purpose of this study is to examine the social welfare implications of international tax competition. Using the Harberger Model and the Laffer Curve, it was hypothesized that if the rate fall below a certain revenue maximizing point, then competition will have a negative effect on the welfare of the individual by either higher personal income tax rates or a decrease in public social spending. Using a modification of Jan K. Brueckner's reaction function, 29 of the OECD countries were tested using panel data dating from 1990 to 2007. The results suggest that tax competition has a significant impact on social welfare; however, the results also indicate that countries are still operating above the maximum revenue point. If tax competition continues at the same pace, then social welfare could negatively be affected.
This study investigates the effects direct to consumer advertisements (DTCA) has on price and demand in the pharmaceutical industry. Using a cross-section model  to test 27 advertised prescription drugs for the years 2009 and 2010 the variables are constructed from relevant literature, empirical findings, and laws of demand. The other variables being affected by price are the number of prescription drugs competing in a market, size of the market, number of years a firm has been out on the market, and  the intensity of price. The statistical analysis provides evidence that DTCA has an effect on advertised prescription drugs.
This paper investigates whether school quality has an impact on housing prices.  Also, it examines which measures of school quality have the largest impact on housing prices.  The study was conducted for the Toledo Metropolitan area for housing sales transactions for the year 2011.  Out of all the school quality variables tested, performance index proved to have the largest impact on housing prices.
The film market is a volatile industry in which the ability to predict success is highly valued. This paper hypothesizes that consumer choice of film is causally correlated with the characteristics of the film itself.  This is based on a hedonic theory that proposes consumers' have different relationships with the characteristics of film depending on the market in which it is viewed.  The regression models established in this study provide an analysis of consumer preferences towards characteristics in the domestic blockbuster, domestic art-house, and foreign film markets.  Specific results of the study indicate that domestic consumers value entertainment quality, artistic quality, availability of a film, and whether or not it is a sequel.  Within the independent film market, consumers prefer films with more artistic quality, however in the foreign markets entertainment quality and acting quality are appreciated.  These results support the use of hedonic theory as a means of valuing film and have several real-world implications.
The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between technology adoption and environmentally sustainable growth in developing countries.  Developed countries must first invent the technology they require to reduce their environmental impact, but developing countries have the opportunity to adopt technology that already exists.  It is therefore possible for developing countries to accelerate the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) process and begin reducing their environmental harm at earlier stages of development than was possible for countries that were on the technology frontier.  Using an adapted Solow Growth model it is shown that the growth path of developing countries will follow an EKC trajectory as the steady state of the economy is approached as long as environmentally sustainable technology is introduced into the economy, and, given the opportunity, countries would rather adopt the clean technology of developed countries than innovate their own dirty technology.  The implications are that developing countries can begin reducing their environmental impact before the preferential and compositional shifts, which are traditionally considered necessary by EKC theory, occur.  The empirical findings of this paper support this theory and provide evidence that it will become easier and easier for countries to achieve environmentally sustainable growth as long as technological progress in developed countries continues.
Neoclassical economic thought along with traditional social mindsets existing during the early twentieth century maintained a heteronormative familial structure that was formatted around the idea of a male breadwinner and a female housewife. The onset of the Great Depression market collapse challenged such ideals as men lost their upper hand within the system when their jobs were taken away. The difference between their work and that of their wives was the monetary aspect: market labor earned a wage, household labor did not. Such a separation gave men a valuable place within society leaving women as mere shadows cast within the confines of the home. The economic turmoil may have disrupted the business cycle, but traditional society strived to maintain the gender roles created by neoclassical thought. Tillie Olsen's Yonnondio, John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and Meridel Le Sueur's The Girl are all depression novels depicting a different type of female struggle as the heteronormative familial structure is deconstructed during this era.
This paper uses neoclassical economic principles, game theory, and a wide variety of literature to examine whether altruistic giving can be considered rational. I also observe what preferences individuals have for giving as well as derive an overall demand curve for altruism. By conducting two different treatments of a dictator game in which the price of giving is altered, I found that 60 percent of College of Wooster students made choices consistent with the General Axiom of Revealed Preferences (GARP). For those that did display rational behavior, they are predicted to gain utility by maximizing personal wealth, creating equality, or maximizing social welfare. Further, I created a demand curve for altruism that suggests altruism is a very inelastic good.
The aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which individual risk preferences are contextually dependent. The theory deveoped in this paper extends the way traditional economists have thought about risk behavior to incorporate the way other social scientists have thought about risk behavior. Specifically, the hypothesis being tested in the paper can be stated as: Individuals behave differently towards risks when in a social atmosphere than when they are in isolation. This hypothesis was tested using an experimental design inspired from previous literature in the field. Using regression analysis it was found that there is no statistical significance that individuals behave differently towards risk when in a social atmosphere than when they are in isolation.
This I.S. addresses the University of Chicago's great influence in developing and spreading neoliberal economic doctrine following World War II.  The paper analyzes the Chicago School's role in implementing neoliberal theory into economic development policy, first in Latin America and, later, in the development of Structural Adjustment Policies.  Finally, my I.S. presents an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of Structural Adjustment Policies in promoting economic growth and development.
The hypothesis in this paper tests the impact of positive and negative incentives on worker productivity.  My hypothesis is that both incentive structures will have positive impacts on the productivity of the subjects in an experiment.  However, I believe that negative incentives will be more effective in increasing productivity because of the ideas of loss aversion.  In this paper I develop a model to explain the effort function of a worker with added variables to control for different types of frames for different people.  The theoretical framework in this paper builds upon the Principal-Agent problem and several of its solutions including Efficiency Wage Theory and Gift Exchange Theory.  Also I incorporate several ideas from Prospect Theory in order to explain the loss aversion philosophy.  An experimental methodology is utilized in this paper in order to better control for certain variables and explain specific data from my results.  This paper finds that threats and rewards negatively impact worker production which disagrees with most incentive theory especially the papers discussed in this paper
With the increasing number of water project failures on the African continent, global water concerns have shifted from pure access to sustainable access. Water is vital to rural communities because of household and agricultural needs. Rural communities are most apt to sustain resources through collaboration. But there needs to be greater depth in these collective social processes. Gender roles form the foundation for power dynamics, where men dominate. However, women are affected the most by water factors because they are the primary water procurers. Yet men dominate community level decision-making capacities. Therefore men control the resources. A disregard for women's assets and contributions leads to gaps in water resource management. This study integrates theories of collective action, social capital, gender roles and voice to illustrate the inclusive of gender can improve water resource management in rural communities.
Risk management has been a rising topic of study in the economic literature, as the number of firms using risk management strategies has been increasing in recent decades. This research studies corporate hedging using financial derivative in particular and tests its effects on firm value empirically, before and after the recent financial crisis. Supporting evidence for the positive impact of hedging was found in research but only after certain observations are removed, which reduces the power of the empirical tests.
Firms can select from several different orientations which provide a basic structure of how operations are carried out when dealing with the marketplace. When trying to determine a philosophy towards marketing efforts, firms must consider the interest of the organization itself, the customers, and society. In this paper, the conceptual hypothesis is that firms who recognize the importance of marketing and implement a marketing orientation approach are more likely to obtain higher profits. Briefly, a marketing orientation consists of a customer-oriented approach where the goal is to provide the right product for customers rather than finding the right customers for the product. A great deal of research is required in order to recognize a consumer want and then develop a product or service to satisfy that want. The tests that will be performed intend to provide analysis between profitability and the implementation of a marketing orientation for various firms.
This study investigates the theoretical and empirical sides of the government controlling the money supply and the influence it has on others. Based upon the fundamental form of the five-graph model and edgeworth box, as well as relevant literature, a theoretical model is constructed that establishes the main criteria the  government controls and aspects it merely has an influence on. The hypothesis being tested is the government control of the money supply to influence interest rates in order to minimize its own debt.
This paper uses a cross-sectional gravity equation to measure the impact of terrorism on international tourist flows to 8 European destination countries. The theoretical framework provides a basis for measurements within the gravity equation. The data is averaged between the years 1991-2009 to give a unique perspective on terrorism effects over during the rise of its transparency. The data combines both international and domestic tourism data to investigate the impact of all terrorism within destination countries. The findings indicate that both the amount of terrorist attacks and the number of fatalities due to terrorism negatively impact tourist flows to European destination countries.
Differing from for-profit businesses whose primary goal is gaining profits; nonprofit organizations possess a double-bottom line. Because of this characteristic, nonprofit organizations not only pursue financial sustainability, but also focus on achieving their social missions. Therefore, developing a measurement that can comprehensively reflect the nonprofit organizations' overall performance becomes a challenging undertaking. It's an undertaking that this study chooses to face head on by employing sustainability as a multidimensional measurement of a nonprofit organizations' performance. This study also seeks to find out how organizational structure affects the sustainability of nonprofit performing arts organizations as a whole. Based on the Profit-Maximizing Model, Cobb-Douglas Production Function, Agency Theory, Resource Dependency Theory, and TCC Group's sustainability formula, this research reveals three major findings according to the data from one hundred nonprofit symphony orchestras throughout the United States. First, there is a strong relationship between the organizational structure and the sustainability of nonprofit performing arts organizations. Second, among all the elements that contribute to a nonprofit's organizational structure, the board of directors' factors are most influential to the organization's sustainability. Third, in order to build an effective board, including board members with supportable capacities and skills and developing an appropriate size and structure of voting members can largely benefit a nonprofit performing arts organization with a higher level of sustainability.
As of 2009, the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS reported that 68% of the global AIDS population was living in sub-Saharan Africa. While AIDS is a global epidemic it is concentrated in this geographic region and it affects their economies to a larger scale. This paper hypothesizes that, as there is an increase in AIDS prevalence rates in a given country there will be a decrease in growth. Researchers often use the Solow model to estimate the relationship between AIDS and growth. However, this model has certain disadvantages because it is an aggregated model of the economy and it does not distinguish between workers of varying productivity. Instead this paper will focus on the multi-sector Harris-Todaro model that places workers in three possible groups: the urban formal sector, the urban informal sector and the rural sector. The urban formal sector is home to the most productive workers and studies suggest that urban HIV prevalence rates tend to be higher than rural prevalence rates. Therefore, this paper proposes that the Harris-Todaro model should be more able to predict the impact of AIDS on growth because it distinguishes between workers, versus the Solow model that traditionally underestimates the impact of AIDS on growth. By regressing both the models, this paper hopes to show that the AIDS coefficient associated Harris-Todaro model is more negative than the coefficient associated with the Solow model. While the Solow regression results do find that AIDS has a negative statistically significant impact on growth, the coefficient comparison between the models does not find that the Harris-Todaro AIDS coefficient is more negative.
This paper aims to investigate and empirically test the notion that coastal countries grow faster in comparison to landlocked countries. The theory used in this paper is known as the Logistic Solow model, which is a modification of the commonly used standard Solow model. The theory shows that coastal countries are at an advantage when it comes to international trade with countries from other regions, which brings about a number of factors that facilitate growth. Unfortunately, the empirical tests conducted in this paper fail to find clear-cut evidence in support of the theory probably due to the use of less than perfect data in the analysis.
This study hypothesizes that being part of a monetary union lowers a nation's risk of defaulting on its loans and of going bankrupt. Both an insurance model and an open economy model show a risk reduction benefit for countries that have joined a monetary union. As a result, individual countries can loosen their fiscal policy without any major repercussions since their currency is backed by other member nations. In order to empirically test the hypothesis, a modified risk regression model was tested using monthly data pooled for 13 countries from the years 2000 until 2010 to show the effects monetary union participation, fiscal policy, investors' risk perception and the country's financial market condition have on the default risk. While this conceptual hypothesis holds true on a theoretical basis, it lacks statistical significance to make any inferences using the risk model created.
This research attempts to test the relationship between economic growth and educational sector foreign direct investment in the country of India. An augmented Cobb-Douglas production function is theorized to show the impact of FDI on economic growth through capital accumulation in the economy. This is then further dissected to show the impact of foreign investment into education, specifically within India. An endogenous growth model then follows illustrating how FDI leads to spillovers in the host country. These spillovers are directly applied to India and its education sector. It is hypothesized that FDI in education will lead to economic growth at a faster rate than other service sectors because of its beneficial spillovers. A number of previous studies are summarized to support both the theory and findings of this research. Finally, using a time-series data set ranging from 2006-2011 in quarterly sets, the theorized model is econometrically tested in a number of OLS regressions. When following the proposed theory and including domestic investment, the results provided insignificant evidence not allowing any conclusion to be drawn about FDI in the educational sector and its impact on economic growth. Further analysis, omitting domestic investment, provided clear evidence that FDI into education promotes tremendous growth within India.
This paper uses a two-stage decomposition modified Solow growth model to examine the impact of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) on Chinese aggregate output, which is represented by GDP per capita. A time-series regression and a panel data regression are applied to explore the findings. The results show significant positive relationship between FDI and GDP per capita, but insignificant findings for corruption.
This paper addresses the growing question of charter school efficiency and the production higher academic achievement than traditional public schools. While it is popular belief that charter schools are more efficient and should produce higher academic achievement than traditional public schools for students, it is not always true. Charter schools are public, non-tuition schools that operate separately from the traditional public school district located primarily in urban areas. Although theory supports the belief that charter schools are superior to traditional public schools, various literature show evidence that charter schools only have a small positive impact on academic achievement and are not more efficient. Academic achievement, in this study, is measured using fourth grade Ohio Assessment Tests from 2010-2011using OLS. This study suggests that while charter schools may have higher academic achievement, they are only more efficient with the teacher input in Ohio and peer effects have a greater impact on students' academic achievement.
Many school districts have recently made decisions to consolidate the number of schools within their respective district boundaries. This study examines the impact of school consolidation on student achievement. A sample of schools in the metropolitan Detroit area, an area in which consolidation has occurred, is examined. Three techniques are used to estimate the impacts at the individual school level, and the results are mixed but suggest that there is a negative impact or no impact at all from school consolidation.
The purpose of my research is to explore whether inequality between individuals effects their inclination to cheat when there is money to be earned. The goal of my research is to impose a level of wealth inequality between two subjects in a classroom situation. I will accomplish this by dividing the class in half, then flipping a coin to determine which group will have an initial monetary reward payout. I will then allow each subject to participate in a game of chance (die-under-cup paradigm) where answers are confidential. This game of chance will be twenty repeated die rolls where only one of the six sides of the die has any potential for payout. My hypothesis is that due to aversion of individuals to inequality in either direction, when a wealth inequality is imposed on participants it will lead them to cheat and those participants exposed to inequality to their disadvantage will cheat more.
The goal of this paper is to understand and estimate the degree to which the attractiveness of an applicant in a job application acts to offset the traditional human capital signal of GPA included on the applicants resume.  While many studies have explored the relationship between physical attractiveness and earnings within the labor market, the effect of physical attractiveness on hiring practices has been investigated less.  Using a model of signaling theory in conjunction with a theory of human capital, a theoretical model was constructed to evaluate the hypothesis that physical attractiveness acts as a signal that increases the perception of productivity among employers.  The measure of this effect was obtained through a survey of participants who were asked to act as if they were recruiting officers and screen a job application for the position of sales/office coordinator.  Each participant was presented with a job description and 1 of 16 resume-photograph combinations, varying by photograph attractiveness (very attractive, above average, below average, unattractive) and resume quality (measure by GPA 4.0, 3.35, 2.65, 2.0).  Participants were then asked to rate how good the application was, the likelihood of offering the applicant an interview, the likelihood of offering the applicant a job and the projected performance of the applicant.  Results indicated that physical attractiveness had no impact on productivity evaluations when resumes were low to average quality, but that attractiveness positively impacted participant's evaluations when resumes were of high quality.  The results of this paper provide partial evidence for influences of physical attractiveness within hiring practices.
This paper explores free agency and it's possible effect on player performance, holding all else constant. Free agency is analyzed theoretically and econometrically as a promotion tournament of sorts, where it works as a motivator that gives players the incentive to boost their performance, in order to be rewarded with an overpaid free agent contract. The purpose of this paper, in finding the effect of free agency on performance, is to find whether or not employers in MLB are strategically overpaying free agents in order to elicit greater performance from all players, rather than simply overestimating the worth of such overpaid players.
Natural resource abundance can have a negative impact on the growth of an economy. An increase in natural resources leads to a movement of labor from the other sectors of the economy to the natural resource sector. However, once the increase subsides, the labor cannot easily move from the resource sector. The cost of training and time make the movement back to the other sectors harder for the workers in the resource sector. This paper contributes to the literature by developing an economic model that explores the effects of an increase in the natural resource sector output on the overall economy. Labor is divided into skilled and unskilled labor. The model predicts that overall output suffers from a positive shock in the resource sector. Empirical analysis is performed using time series and Vector Autoregression models and data from Nigeria. Time series results reveal that natural resource abundance has had a negative impact on the growth of Nigeria. Results of the Vector Autoregression model show that a shock in the natural resource sector causes a decline in the real GDP in the first few time periods following the shock.
The focus of this paper is the inverse relationship between underwriter reputation and the underpricing of new issues. New issue underpricing results in money left on the table by issuing firms after an IPO. To avoid leaving money on the table, an issuing firm will hire an underwriter that can afford the risk of low underpricing, in exchange for paying a large spread to the underwriter. It is assumed that underwriters with a strong reputation can afford the risk of low underpricing more easily than underwriters with a weak reputation. In order to improve their reputation, or maintain a strong reputation, underwriters will consistently minimize the underpricing of new issues. In addition to the reputation of the underwriter, underwriter compensation, the age of the issuing firm, syndicate size, and proceeds of the initial sale of stock are compared to the extent of underpricing for each IPO.
Investing in the securities market exposes investors to both market risk and returns. Measurement of expected returns is relatively easy since there is a generally accepted method of calculation. However, there is no consensus on the best way of quantifying security risk. The classical method is to use variance; over time, a number of alternative methods have been developed. This paper contributes to literature by examining the explanatory power of the nine most cited alternative risk measures in a comprehensive model. Empirical analysis is performed using regression analysis. The main result of the paper is the observation of a direct relationship between risk and returns, as predicted by theory. The risk measures that display consistent, significant explanatory power are Sharpe's β, kurtosis, value at risk and market capitalization. Results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality connfirm that 82% of the security returns did not come from a normal distribution. The paper also develops the critical line algorithm used for calculating optimal portfolios leading to the derivation of the efficicient frontier.
Foreign aid as a stimulant for economic reform in developing countries has been questioned in recent years due to the lack of increases in per capita income. However, during this time, the quality of the institutions receiving aid has been viewed as more important. It has been theoretically hypothesized that a country will grow economically if they have good institutions and receive sufficient funding through foreign aid. This paper empirically analyses both the aid and institutional quality variables individually on the growth of a developing country. Additionally, these variables have been analyzed as an interaction variable on the dependent variable. It has been concluded that aid will stimulate economic growth within a country, holding everything else constant. Additionally, institutional quality will have a positive effect on economic growth, ceteris paribus. However, it is not necessary for a country to have both of these things simultaneously. It has also been concluded that there is a nonlinear relationship between aid and growth. Therefore, aid is only beneficial up to a certain point. If too much aid is granted, it can have detrimental effects on the economic growth of a developing country.
This paper utilizes regression analysis and panel data of one hundred fifty-four developing countries. The empirical model is operationalized using a modified Nelson-Phelps theoretical framework, endogenous growth theory, and Dunning’s OLI theory. The constructed model tests the concepts that Foreign Direct Investment inflows from developed countries significantly impact Total Factor Productivity growth, that Total Factor Productivity impacts output growth, and that typical FDI determinants related to institutional quality and policy manipulation impact developed country FDI inflows. This paper finds that FDI from developed countries do not significantly impact TFP growth, but that TFP growth does impact output growth. The institutional quality and policy variables that are hypothesized to impact developed FDI inflows are found insignificant. This research finds that the difference between a measurement of the developed leader country’s productivity and that of a given following developing country potentially impacts output growth.
Ever since the concept of market efficiency was defined, individuals have been trying to find ways to measure, test, and show different levels of efficiency in markets. Efficient markets show a reflection in value from information. This study concerns itself with the market for securities. Specifically, it is concerned with the question, ‘What effect does the options market have on the efficiency of the underlying security?’ Given the above question, this study takes the position that the options market has a narrowing effect on the transactions cost of a security, which stands as a measure of market efficiency. As such, it is noted that the existence of the option allows dealers to better value the underlying security, and thus the market is more efficient. This study derives an option pricing model, follows it with a theoretical section, and then outlines the expected negative relationship between the options market and the efficiency of a market, due to the options market being an additional piece of relevant information regarding the security’s future performance. It then offers an empirical test of this hypothesis, the results of which do not support this hypothesis.
This study aims to understand the motives behind states’ selectivity regarding international intervention during times of crisis. Using a quantitative statistical analysis, the study tests four hypotheses to see if the likelihood of military intervention increases during instances of politicide or genocide when the state experiencing the crisis contains economic incentives such as oil or a valuable trading relationship. The study investigates the instances of military intervention for cases of politicide and genocide between years 1956-2006. The findings reveal that a state’s likelihood for providing military intervention decreases when the state that is in need of help has large oil reserves. The results also show that a strong import based relationship does increase the likelihood of the state being provided with military intervention; while export based trading relationships show no significant results.
Some countries pursue nuclear weapons, while others do not. What could be the reason behind this? In this project, I carry out a comparative case study between the countries of South Korea and Japan in order to understand why they did not go nuclear in the aftermath of the 2006 North Korean nuclear test. In fact, North Korea carried out two more nuclear tests since 2006 but neither South Korea nor Japan has shown evidence of going nuclear. The three primary theories of realism, liberalism, and constructivism are used to analyze the non-pursuit of nuclear weapons by both these countries, and form the essence of this qualitative analysis. I primarily rely upon Scott Sagan’s three models to study nuclear non-pursuit, but also make a few changes to some of the independent variables. The realist security guarantees with the United States seems to be the strongest indicator of non-pursuit in South Korea. In the case of Japan, I conclude that many liberal notions of non-pursuit such as public opinion have roots in a constructivist variable and that leads me to proclaim norms and identity as the strongest variables, though security guarantees are important in the case of Japan too.
Education is a vital component of any economy, which is why the large education quality disparities present in the United States are problematic. This paper seeks to employ theory, previous research, as well as empirical work to understand the causes of this disparity so that more effective policies may be implemented to correct it. The theoretical analysis herein determines the characteristics of education as a good, determining that it is both a partially-public good as well as a merit good. The rest of the theoretical analysis is examined within this framework. This empirical study seeks to determine the factors that influence education quality by using data from the 2009-2010 school year in California and the state’s Academic Performance Index (API) as a proxy for educational quality. It becomes evident that the majority of the factors that influence educational quality are student and parent characteristics and not those of the educational system itself. 
This paper empirically studies the relationship between human capital and economic growth. The role of institutions, advanced as an important determinant of growth, is also examined. Human capital is hypothesized to positively affect growth through the enhancement of worker capabilities. Political institutions are hypothesized to be an important factor in creating and maintaining an environment conducive to growth. Using panel data of East and Southeast Asian countries from 1985 to 2010 an empirical model is constructed to statistically test the effect of primary school enrollment on GDP per capita growth in addition to other important variables. The results indicate that growth is significantly fostered by primary school enrollment, investment, and GDP per capita. No statistically significant evidence of institutional variables, measuring democracy and corruption, being important for growth is found. These findings support the primary hypothesis that the development of human capital is key in stimulating growth.
"What are the impacts and legacies of the United States in Latin America? There is a long history and tumultuous relationship between the two. Especially in the Cold War period, there is much evidence of extensive U.S. intervention in the region. While much of this involvement has been documented by the press and activists, this paper strives to further our understanding as a society of the consequences of our actions and assistance. The question that this work posits is: what impacts did economic and military aid given by the United States have on Latin American regimes' human rights violations during the Cold War? Due to availability of data, the period to be studied is 1976-1996, which follows the end of the Cold War. Other variables studied for their possible impacts on human rights violations include democracy, involvement in international or civil wars, international law, economic development and growth, poverty, population and population growth. While the findings of the quantitative analysis show mixed significance of these variables, there are some clear, significant relationships that have important ramifications for our understanding of history and policy.
¿Qué son los impactos y las legacías de los Estados Unidos para con Latinoamérica? Hay una historia larga y una relación tumultuosa entre los dos. Particularmente durante la Guerra Fría, existe mucha evidencia extensa de intervención por parte de los EEUU en la región. Mientras que muchas de las implicaciones han sido documentadas por la prensa y los activistas, el presente trabajo se esfuerza por profundizar nuestra comprensión como una sociedad de las consecuencias de nuestras acciones y asistencia. La cuestión que asienta este trabajo propone es, ¿qué impactos ha tenido la ayuda económica y militar estadounidense en cuanto a las violaciones de los derechos humanos durante la Guerra Fría? Por la falta de datos disponibles, el período que va a ser estudiado es 1976-1996, que coincide con el fin de la Guerra Fría. Otras variables estudiadas por sus impactos posibles respecto a las violaciones de los derechos humanos incluyen la democracia, la participación en guerras internacionales y domésticas, la ley internacional, el desarrollo económico, el crecimiento económico, la pobreza, la población y el crecimiento de la población. Mientras que los resultados del análisis cuantitativo muestran niveles diferentes de significancia para las variables, existen algunas relaciones claras y significantes que tienen ramificaciones importantes para nuestro entendimiento de la historia y la política."
"Societies recovering from conflict often experience the destruction of infrastructure, GDP, livelihood stability, and political, social, and economic systems, which can cause extreme disruption to the economic wellbeing and self-sufficiency of households in the conflict-affected region. It is widely accepted that entrepreneurial activity is important to the growth and development of economies, yet there is a remarkable lack of research into the factors that promote small enterprise creation in a post-conflict context, where families have often experienced destruction of their income and earning ability.
This study aims to uncover the impact of human, social, and financial capital on entry into subsistence entrepreneurship in post-conflict settings. Using data from the Nepal Living Standards Survey, a comprehensive household survey conducted in the midst of the Nepali Civil War of 1996-2006, the relative importance of these three types of capital on entry into subsistence entrepreneurship is analyzed. This study offers insights into the importance of human, social, and financial capital as inputs to subsistence enterprises in post-conflict environments, and it highlights new areas of research that will help identify future policy and advocacy avenues that can alleviate the impacts of conflict on household income and wellbeing."
This project addresses the research question: why do leaders of nationalist movements decide to pursue secession? The main hypothesis of this study is that the leadership style of the head of the nationalist movement determines whether or not he or she decides to pursue secession.  A review of the relevant literature identifies that this question has not been adequately studied. In an effort to address this question, leadership decision-making literature, in particular leadership trait analysis, is applied to nationalist leaders. Three leadership styles were developed: the modified expansionist style where the leader will decide to pursue secession no matter what the circumstance; the modified opportunist style where the leader will decide to pursue secession if the majority of the nation wants to secede; and the accordant style where the leader will decide to not pursue secession without exception. These styles are tested by coding interview responses for three nationalist movement leaders: Alex Salmond of Scotland, Artur Mas of Catalonia, and Kris Peeters of Flanders. After analyzing the data of the personality trait scores, the findings are inconclusive because of methodological difficulties and assumptions that proved to be incorrect. Changes need to be made and further experiments should be conducted to come to conclusive results; however, this study does add information to scholars’ knowledge on this topic. 
Due to the increasing number of women in the labor force, opportunity costs associated with labor force participation are becoming an important factor in fertility decisions. Further, these decisions are assumed to be dynamic as the opportunity costs change as a woman progresses through her career. A Bayesian statistical model , which allows the distribution of the likelihood of having children to be updated as information is gathered, lends itself to the dynamicity of the decision-making process. A generalized model for fertility decisions in terms of labor force participation is created. I also discuss potentials for implementation and furthering the model.
Charles de Gaulle dominates the history of 20<sup>th</sup> Century France. He led his country’s resistance to Nazi Germany, created and guided the institutions of the Fifth Republic, and shaped the structure of modern-day France. On the world stage, however, de Gaulle struggled to assert France’s independence and grandeur, the two driving forces of his foreign policy. This independent study examines three key moments in French foreign relations after de Gaulle became President of the newly created Fifth Republic in 1959. For de Gaulle, ideology was more important than advancing traditional economic, political, and military interests. While these interests factored into de Gaulle’s decision making process, they were always subordinate to his desire to see France regain its place as an independent, influential, and grand power in the world stage. This motivation can be seen in de Gaulle’s relations with the European Community, where he risked the failure of the entire organization to maintain France’s privileged place in Europe. De Gaulle’s prioritization of ideology is also apparent in his pursuit of nuclear weapons, which provided France with military “elite” status, but no real national security benefit. De Gaulle’s decision to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s military structure was also driven by his determination to assert France’s independence in foreign policy, although he got nothing but ire in return.

The “Kurdish Question” is a perceived security threat that continues to be faced by states that contain the Kurds, the largest ethnic transnational minority in the Middle East. The ebb and flows of rising Kurdish nationalism and the potential for border instability frequently causes states to heavily reprimand Kurdish ambitions, often causing violent Kurdish reactionary events. This study hopes to understand what specific state discriminatory policies towards the Kurds cause the most violent Kurdish reaction. Using a comparative case study of Turkey, Iraq and Syria, the study compares subgroups of discriminatory state policies (economic, political, and cultural) to determine the documented level of violence of the correlated Kurdish reaction.

Does the direct targeting of civilians and non-combatants have any affect on the likelihood of success in civil war? While this tactic, known as categorical terrorism, constitutes severe war crimes, it is nonetheless employed by armed non-state actors in countless conflicts around the world. Using a series of eight models, this study seeks to understand the impact, if any, categorical terrorism has on the likelihood of success for armed non-state actors. Using a large-N analysis of every civil war that has taken place between 1970 and 2003, this study seeks to accomplish two objectives: to understand how categorical terrorism influences civil war outcomes and to provide information that will hopefully lead to proactive policy measures aimed at protecting civilians and non-combatants.
This paper theoretically and empirically evaluates the role of trust in business organizations by focusing on trustworthiness as it relates to the broader subject of compensation structure. To postulate the hiring of a trustworthy individual as a potential third solution to combat the commitment of moral hazard in the principal-fiduciary relationship, this study utilizes a two-stage operational model to assess the role that individual preference has on executive shirking levels. An OLS modeling technique is used to estimate the regression functions and coefficients for a cross-sectional sample of 110 manufacturing firms. Ultimately finding the trust model to be insignificant, results give little evidence to support the hypothesis that the characteristics of trustworthy individuals have any explanatory power over the difference between actual and predicted levels of incentive pay. Attributing this insignificance largely to the omission of variables due to lack of available data on executive biographical information, this study cautiously offers the hesitant finding that investment in social capital can potentially be utilized to hire an inherently trustworthy executive. As a secondary finding, the CEOs tenure with the company was found to be a significant determinant of the proportion of incentive pay, suggesting that greater focus should be placed on individual characteristics when setting executive compensation structure. In all, this study highlights the need for a more complete biographical database so further research can continue with a larger sample size and more efficient operational measures of trust.
This research brings China's economic growth and growth of Christianity in post-Reform urban China into focus, at the very same time. Using interdisciplinary approach and employing research methods from both disciplines, this research explains the ways rapid economic growth has led to dramatic social transformation in urban China after the 1980s, which has resulted in significant shifts in the Chinese cultural and religious landscapes. Through conducting empirical testing of the 2007 Spiritual Life Study of Chinese Residents household survey, the research found out that family as a close-knit, culturally significant social network had the strongest influence on urban Chinese' decision-making of religious affiliation. Income alone did not have significant enough an impact on such decision. Chinese communist government was still perceived as a negative influence on religious affiliation with Christianity.
This thesis hypothesizes that the state of Ohio education finance system does not provide sufficient education grant money to local school districts to fill the gap between expenditure need and local revenue-raising capacity. Theories of fiscal capacity and intergovernmental grants explain how miscalculation of education costs causes the state government to underfund public schools. In order to test the hypothesis empirically, a regression model is tested using panel data for 606 Ohio public school districts for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012. This model shows the effects of revenue-raising capacity, expenditure need, and other control variables on the amount of grant money distributed to each district by the state government. The results from the regression analysis provide evidence supporting the hypothesis of this thesis, and have significant policy implications for the Ohio education system.
"Research on income inequality in the United States, generally, neglects the subject’s inherent philosophical content because of economics’ propensity to avoid evaluative judgments. In result, John Rawls’s theory of justice, a better conception of justice than those often presumed by economists, is disregarded in policy conversations about income inequality. This thesis has two objectives: 1) to demonstrate that economics fails to acknowledge the link between theories of distributive justice and income inequality, and in consequence, economists are settling for a weaker theory of justice. 2) To examine what Rawls’s theory of justice implies for the United States’ current income distribution.
I achieve the first objective in two parts. In Part One I illustrate the link between distributive justice, politics, and income inequality by examining income inequality’s causes, impacts, and current and historical statistics. In Part Two, I present three theories of justice – utilitarianism, Robert Nozick’s libertarianism, and John Rawls’s liberalism. I achieve my second objective in Part Three, where I examine what Rawls’s theory implies for income inequality in the United States. I find that Rawls’s principles of justice, specifically the difference principle, calls for policy that equalizes opportunity."
The impact of foreign graduate students on the level of innovation in the United States is an important topic. This paper contributes to the literature by developing an economic model that explores the effects of foreign graduate students and postdoctorates on the national innovation capacity of the US. The economic model draws from Solow and Romer and the results indicate that postdoctorates have a significant and positive impact on innovation capacity of the US. Ceteris paribus, a 1% increase in foreign postdoctorates per labor force leads to an 11.85% increase in patent grants, three years after the inputs after employed. Similarly, a 1% increase in foreign postdoctorates per labor force increases patent grants by 16.00%, five years after the inputs are employed. The results from foreign graduate students show a significant but negative relationship with innovation activity. Upon conclusion, foreign postdoctorates play an important role in expanding US national innovation capacity.
Oil is an important production resource in China’s economic growth. China has been a net-oil import country since 1993. Relying on oil imports brings risks to China’s economic growth and national security. This paper seeks to apply theory, previous literature and empirical methods to examine oil import risks’ influences on China’s economic growth. Using the growth model and data from 1986 to 2012, the results indicate that risk factors do not have direct impacts on China’s economic growth. However, some risk factors have significant impacts on China’s total petroleum consumption; and petroleum consumption has positive influences on economic growth. In other words, risk factors have indirect impacts on China’s economic growth through petroleum consumption. It is important for China to maintain oil imports and China is adopting more strategies to reduce oil import risks.
While there are many determinants as to what draws foreign direct investment (FDI) to developing countries such as macroeconomic conditions and political determinants, the focus here will be on judicial institutions. Depending on the quality of courts within developing countries, academic research shows that there exists variation in the amount of FDI received. Stable judicial institutions and legalism consist of adherence to rule of law, rational-legal enforcement, and efficient liberal courts. Data from the World Governance Indicator (WGI) that entails six dimensions of a quality judicial system is used to measure the judicial strength of the case study countries of interest: Chile, Panama, and Nicaragua. The data collected, which measured judicial strength is also accompanied by empirical research that focuses on outside companies and investor relationship in particular industries within the case study countries. The research findings uphold that judicial institutions and legalism impact FDI variation in developing countries.  
Although women in developing countries play a significant role in the agricultural sector, they are faced with economic, social, and cultural constraints that limit their access to agricultural productive resources. This study examines the impact of agricultural technology and human capital on gender inequality. The theory used in this paper is the human capital augmented Solow model, which is a modification of the standard Solow growth model. The model predicts that, due to the gender bias against women, agricultural technology and human capital will not reduce gender inequality in developing economies. The empirical results are mixed but suggest that agricultural technology has no impact on gender inequality, while female education, a measure of human capital, has no impact or negatively impacts gender inequality.
The conflict between exclusivity and universalism is a consistent theme in international relations. In modern history this conflict is prominent in the often-hostile relationship between internationalism and state self-interest, easily seen in the founding of the United Nations (UN) in 1945. Though its importance is sometimes downplayed, the UN had tremendous potential, and history might have taken intriguing routes if the organization had been organized along different lines. One could argue that the UN took the path it did due to its ideological influences. The UN Charter, emblematic of the new organization, is the ideal document to observe these influences. This study examines three ideological forces and their influence on the Charter: Realism, characterized by the self-interest of states in international relations; World Federalism, which advocated a democratic-republican world federal government; and Dissident Marxism, promulgated by members of the anti-Stalinist left who wanted to implement their version of socialism globally. I first examine the theoretical literature of each of these schools of thought, then codify their principles in my methodology section. Then, I examine the extent to which each set of principles overlap with the Charter thus indicating (though not explicitly establishing) the degree to which they were able to influence that system. The final chapter examines my findings and potential structures of further research. I come to the conclusion that realism’s influence is the largest influence on the Charter, with World Federalism having a degree of influence, and Dissident Marxism having the smallest influence. The ideology with the strongest state power behind it, realism had the most influence, and the ideology with essentially no state power, Dissident Marxism, had the least influence. This suggests a positive correlation between state power and influence on documents of international affairs as well as a limit to the strength of ideas and ideology.
This study examines the impact of socio-cultural factors on the bargaining power of women and on their participation in non-household production in Tanzania. Based on economic theory, we hypothesize that the existence of socio-cultural factors decreases the bargaining power of women and limits their participation in non-household production. Using the 2006 Tanzania Integrated Labor Force Survey, we empirically test this hypothesis by running robust regressions, which uses time spent on the main activity as the dependent variable. Our results indicate that when husbands share household responsibilities with their wives, women who primarily engage in unpaid household activities devote less time on housework per week, while the women in agriculture and self- employment devote more time towards their respective activities.
This thesis explores the factors that have contributed to the emergence of a fundamentalist Islamic movement in Turkey and the direction this movement is currently moving towards. Two theories of social change that specifically focus on fundamentalist movements in Islamic countries were used. In order to provide substance for these theories the socio-political and economic history of the Turkey was explainedin the literature review section. The implications of the theories were tested by analyzing three sources: a Piar-Gallup survey that shows the attitude of the fundamentalist party's (RP) voters about Tukey's current situation, the economic agenda of the RP, and a speech given by the leader of the RP at their annual congress. These sources confirmed that the traces of the Islamic background of Turkey and the socio-political and economic situations it went through after the republic was founded make it inevitable for an Islamic revivalism to emerge. The analysis of the data also showed that the RP is making good use of the current socio-political and economic realities of Turkey and consequently increasing its support. The study, as a whole, suggests that understanding and tolderance are the key virtues to have in resolving the conflict created between the Islamic fundamentalists and liberals in Turkey.
"This study looks into why employers offer benefits as a general component of employee compensation, and then looks specifically at retirement plans as an employee benefit that can be used by employers as a tool to attract and retain specific employees. It looks into employee and employer factors of retirement plans and seeks to determine which of these general factors are more important in an employee’s participation in an employer sponsored retirement plan.
Careful analysis of cross-sectional participant level data leads to the conclusion that both employer and employee factors are important in retirement plan participation. While the results of this analysis did not always coincide with the anticipated results, the findings were significant and point to some surprising results."
"This paper focuses on an investigation of public policy aimed at increasing social welfare via resource redistribution, focusing on productive public spending such as investments in health and education. The study applies the theories of the Edgeworth Box model and the Social welfare function in understanding the dynamics between allocations, inequality and the level of welfare within society. These basic models are then expanded by analyzing the impact of augmenting the production possibility frontier on both the ultimate outcome in the Edgeworth box and the on the level of welfare in society. We hypothesize that productive public spending, inclusive of both investments in health and education, will impact the outcome represented in the Edgeworth box in such a way that it reduces inequality and impacts the production frontier such that it increases the level of output that the economy produces. A review of literature is included, after which a model specification is designed to empirically test the relationships described in the hypothesis. The results show that there is statistical evidence to suggest that health spending has an enhancing effect on output, but that it also increases inequality. On the other hand, education spending has a reductive effect on inequality but it also decreases economic output. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this study and make recommendations for future research.

"As a result of colonialism and foreign occupation of Africa, a new group of actors emerged in the 20<sup>th</sup> century: the African elite.  These actors, emerging in the final days of colonialism, are prominent across the continent.  Understanding the factors that created this group is important to understand how they act in today’s global society. By comparing the domestic colonial experiences in Senegal and Kenya, this study seeks to determine the connection between colonial native education policies and the formation of the local elite, which goes hand in hand with the creation of their political consciousness.  This thesis uses comparative case studies to see if this phenomenon is unique, or can be seen as a greater African trend.  The French system valued complete assimilation of the Africans to French culture, while the British tried to apply British culture and influence to the African-specific cultures in their colonies. While the French intended to have an elite group of Africans to run the lower levels of the bureaucracy, the British sought to prevent an elite out of fear that they would threaten the stability of the colony.  Regardless of the differences between colonial powers, it is evident that whether the French were seeking to assimilate their subjects, or the British to associate theirs, education was the most powerful tool to do so.  With more education came a greater grasp of the racism, class distinctions, and exploitation—all of which were put in place to ensure the Africans remained at the lowest social, political and economic tier of the colony.  I find that native education was instrumental in the creation of a small group of influential politically conscious Africans to oppose colonial control.  These men would prove to be important leaders during colonial times to test the limits of colonial control, and to advocate for the right of an independent Africa.  These are the same men who would gain control after independence and influence the new wave of an African elite.



Après la colonisation, il y avait une nouvelle groupe social: les élites Africains.  Aujourd’hui, il y a beaucoup des problèmes en Afrique : l’issue démocratisation, la corruption politique, et aussi les divisions ethnique et religieuse.  Dans les états avec ces problèmes, il y a souvent un petit groupe des chefs.  Je propose que la naissance  de ce group des élites arrive de l’origine de l’éducation indigène pendant l’époque coloniale.  Avec les compréhensions d’origine des élites, on peut comprendre leurs motivations, leurs actions et trouver les solutions pour engager avec eux.  Je fais des comparaisons entre la situation coloniale dans les colonies de Sénégal, une colonie Française, et Kenya, une colonie d’Angleterre. Je fais cette comparaison parce qu’il montre que, indépendant de différentes philosophies coloniales, les deux colonies se sont retrouvées avec une place pour les élites africaines d'émerger comme dirigeants viables. J’utilise une collection des sources comprises des annonces officielles,  des photos, des cartes, et des recensements coloniales.  Aussi les recherches des autres scolaires m’aident beaucoup alors que je comprends la nature de l’éducation et les élites.  À la fin, j’ai trouvée que l’éducation indigène a crée quelques privilégiés avec les dons à critiquer le gouvernement colonial et modifier la société Africaine.  Ces gens sont une partie d’une groupe qui a mené l’Afrique à devenir indépendant, et qui a développé l’identité Pan-Africain.  "
This study investigates the relationship between insurgency strategy, counterinsurgency response, and the outcome of the counterinsurgency operation. Despite the presence of irregular warfare throughout history, governments and militaries continue to possess a strong distaste for this style of conflict. Rather, militaries prefer to fight conventional wars, which follow protocol and rules of engagement. As a result, insurgencies and COIN strategies are severely understudied, leaving a gap in the literature. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, coupled with the publication of the U.S. Field Manual 3-24, have revitalized the study of counterinsurgency once more. The research conducted in this study analyzes what COIN strategy is most successful, depending on the type of insurgency movement? Four insurgency strategies are studied: conspiratorial approach, urban warfare, military-focus approach, and protracted popular warfare. Likewise, there are four counterinsurgency strategies studied: hearts-and-minds, stability operations, search and destroy, and occupation. A mixed method of statistical analysis and four descriptive case studies are employed to answer this research question. In conclusion, a surprising disconnect was discovered between COIN literature and policy, resulting in major policy implications.
The establishment of peace in post-genocidal states is vital, as the experience of extreme division and violence can scar a population, contributing to violence and inequality moving forward. Existing literature on post-conflict transition and governance argues that two main systems are typically used: consociationalism and assimilationism. While consociationalism argues for heterogeneity in the state and assimilationism for homogeneity, both of these systems use the institutionalization of identity as a step in post-conflict recovery, through such means as proscribing or privileging particular identities. This study posits that this is inherently flawed, as attempts to institutionalize identity ignore its contextually fluid or fixed nature. In using Bosnia-Herzegovina and Rwanda as case studies for the hypotheses of consociationalism and assimilationsim, respectively, this research finds that such institutionalization not only fails to support development towards sustainable peace, but actually inhibits it. This supports the alternative hypothesis proposed by this study, that post-conflict recovery and reconciliation is dependent on 'thick' understandings of local contexts and the honoring of diversity over fixed categorization.
This research effort examines the relationship between the Value-added tax and the distribution of social welfare. The main hypothesis of this effort argues that implementation of and reliance on a Value-added tax will lead to more equitable distributions of social welfare. Relevant theories of public finance and literature reviews of peer-edited articles are provided as support for the empirical work performed to test this hypothesis. Using a panel of 34 OECD member states over the period between 1995 and 2010, fixed-effects and random-effects regression models are run. The results of the fixed-effects model do not conform to the hypothesis while the results of the random-effects model do. While the results conflict, the findings do suggest that the propensity to spend government revenue on social policy areas is crucial for a more equitable distribution of social welfare. It is therefore implied that the Value-added tax is an effective tool to raise the necessary funds for this purpose but such a tool will lead to beneficial welfare effects only if its revenues are spent in a socially optimal way.
"This Independent Study Thesis answers two main questions and then combines those answers to form a cohesive policy recommendation for intervention into genocide. The first question is whether intervention into genocide can be successful. And the second is whether intervention can be ethical. The question of success is answered by a comparative case study on the interventions into East Timor, Kosovo, and Darfur. The ethical question is answered through an evaluation of rule-utilitarianism as well as cosmopolitan arguments. The thesis is divided into seven chapters.
            The first chapter is the literature review. It explains how to define genocide and then moves on to evaluate the state of the existing literature on the subject. The second chapter is the theory chapter and evaluates overarching international relations theories; as well as ethical theories and theories of the state. The third chapter is the methodology and lays out the form of the case study. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters are the case analyses themselves, and deal with East Timor, Kosovo, and Darfur respectively. The seventh chapter answers the ethical question. It confronts whether states can have moral obligations, and then formulates an obligation to assist.
            The results suggest three important things. There can be successful intervention into genocide. There can be ethical intervention into genocide. And, most importantly, that these two are not mutually exclusive. I then conclude with a policy recommendation for ethical and successful intervention into genocide."
The focus of this paper is to evaluate the impact that different degrees of involvement in the Wooster community have on the individual contribution decision of various Wooster alumni who are asked to make a contribution to the Wooster Fund. The contribution decision is a resource allocation dilemma in which an individual has to determine how much of his or her budget constraint to spend on competing goods in order to maximize his or her utility. In the case of Wooster alumni, the competing goods are goods that satisfy consumption preferences and goods that satisfy donation preferences. The assumption of this paper is that Wooster Alumni who belonged to organizations of various types while they attended Wooster can be predicted to donate to the Wooster Fund at a greater level than alumni who did not participate in organized collectives, because of the mission engagement-enhancing effect that group membership has on the contribution decision function. A data set of Wooster alumni contribution levels and descriptive statistics is analyzed econometrically in order to provide support for this hypothesis. Group membership is determined by the results of the analysis to be an important variable in the contribution decision, at least in this case study of Wooster Alumni contribution.
My independent study attempts to answer the research question: Given shifting dynamics in Al-Qaeda (AQ) in the aftermath of Osama bin Laden’s death, how has the relationship between AQ Central and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) changed? After the assassination of Osama bin Laden and rise of ISIS some have discounted AQ as an imminent threat. Continued attacks against US interests in the Arabian Peninsula by AQAP reveal that Al-Qaeda’s global network is not to be underestimated and continues to thrive. Therefore, my project has important counterterrorism implications and the potential to enhance current conceptions of how Al-Qaeda Central relates to its affiliates. The literature provides “assessments” of affiliates or addresses dynamics of global terror networks. A major gap in the literature exists due to a lack of theoretical work. Adapting Daniel Byman’s model for the state sponsorship of terrorism, I attempt to fill this gap. Using a pre/post-test comparative case study design, I employ process tracing to look for variation in control or coordination in the relationship. Specifically I look at the extent that AQ Central is involved in various AQAP activities before and after Osama bin Laden’s assassination in 2011.
            This research adds to the literature by applying a new model to the analysis of the interactions between school districts and teachers’ union. By utilizing an ultimatum game framework, a theoretical model of how the negotiation process between school districts and teachers’ unions influences the allocation of educational resources is created. This theoretical construct is then tested with an empirical model that tests the influence of union power upon the allocation of educational resources and the influence of the allocations of school resources upon educational attainment. This paper finds that although teachers’ unions do have an influence upon the allocation of school resources, those allocations of school resources do not have significant influence over educational attainment. As a result, this paper finds evidence that union power does not influence educational attainment but instead that independent variables outside the control of either party, school districts or teachers’ unions, are the major factors in determining levels of educational attainment.
This paper tests the impact in which terrorism has upon economic growth. There is some discrepancy as to how large the impact of terrorism is on economies. In order to understand this relationship we run traditional growth regressions while adding terrorism variables in order to assess the impact. The sample which we use contains both terrorism and GDP data from 30 different countries from the years 1968 through 2007. We run four separate models each of which allow us to examine terrorisms effects in different ways. The first regression that is ran is a panel regression that uses GDP per capita growth as the independent variable. The second uses the log difference of GDP per capita in an attempt to control for variance. The third regression is a cross-sectional regression aimed at understanding terrorisms effects on long run GDP per capita growth. Our fourth and final model is an attempt to recreate the panel regression ran by Bloomberg, Hess and Orphanides. The results that we obtained from our regressions were inconclusive on the effect which terrorism has on economic growth.
External state intervention is a complex phenomenon which crosses the disciplinary line between economics and political science. When modeling the decision to intervene, many investigations fail to consider the role of economic interests. We hypothesize that economic interests play a role in the decision to intervene. Our paper applies realist and liberal international relations theories to a rational choice framework. From these theories, we gather that security, economic, and political interest matter in the decision making process. We use a logit model to empirically test our theoretical model and fail to find significant evidence to support our hypothesis. However, we provide evidence that using all states other than the conflict state as potential interveners, ex-ante intervention, as the unit of analysis allows for a more accurate model of the decision making process
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are two government-sponsored enterprises that received significant attention for their role in the 2007 mortgage crisis. These agencies must fulfill goals laid out by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that are intended to increase homeownership among borrowers who are traditionally underserved by the mortgage market. In this paper I test the hypothesis that affordable housing goals increase the availability of credit to targeted borrowers. These borrowers would usually not receive a mortgage because they are not as profitable as less risky borrowers. To test the impact of affordable housing goals I develop a theoretical model that explains the contributing factors in the decision to lend and how GSE activity impacts this decision. To determine the impact of affordable housing goals on the lending decision a regression model is conceptualized and estimated using tract level aggregate data. My findings show signs that GSE purchases reduce the denial rate in low-income tracts targeted by affordable housing goals. The result of this is greater access to credit for targeted borrowers.
In the following paper, the inter-industry differences in the effect of advertising on the performance of the firm will be analyzed. While much literature has contributed to advertising with other variables such as profitability and concentration, few have studied how this effect may differ between firms in consumer goods industries and firms in producer goods industries. The hypothesis that is tested is that if advertising has a positive and significant relationship with firm performance, then this effect will be stronger for firms in consumer goods industries. A two-stage least squares regression is run to test the hypothesis, but the results turn up insignificant, resulting in not enough sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the industries.

In this study, I will be analyzing the factors that affected nuclear strategy during the Obama administration. At the beginning of his term, President Obama, through rhetoric and action, put the reduction of the role of nuclear weapons as a main goal of his administration. This was asserted through directives such as his 2009 “Remarks in Prague” speech and the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review. However, starting in 2014, his policy shifted. As seen in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review, for example, this new strategy focused on modernizing nuclear weapons and the importance of these weapons as a deterrence factor. In my study, I will be using a neoclassical realist framework in order to better understand this policy shift. This viewpoint is the most useful because it accounts for systemic level factors, such as the balance of power, but also takes into account other factors, such as domestic politics and elite perceptions. Additionally, since neoclassical realism is best used for explaining security issues and foreign policy decision-making, this case will be a strong test of the descriptive, explanatory, and predictive powers of the neoclassical realist theory.

This study examines the impact that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has had on economic growth in economies within the Southern African Development Committee (SADC) in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Based on the Solow model, the study hypothesizes that, by acting as a conduit for the transfer of technology from technologically advanced countries to developing countries, FDI has accelerated economic growth in the SADC region. Using panel data from the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) that covered from 2000-2012, results of the study show that FDI has not had significant influence on economic growth in the SADC region. The study attributes these results to poor human capital stock, which emanates from SADC member states’ poor performance in the education sector.
Th research studies the relationship of trade and wage inequality in upper-middle-income countries. Specifically, the research questions how trade between upper-middle-income countries and both developed and lower-income countries affect the wage inequality. We use Heckscher-Ohlin model and Stolper-Samuelson theorems to study the relationship between trade and factor prices. We use panel data models on fifteen countries from 1975-1966 and the results suggest that we do not have the same results as explained by Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson theorem. 
"In this paper, I adopt the framework of the political business cycle to derive a model of politician decision making with regard to international trade policy.  To test my model, I estimate a probit regression using a unique data set of 18 U.S. Senate votes on trade liberalization from 1993-2011.  My regression measures the impact of impending reelection on an incumbent politician’s trade policy choice, controlling for the capital-labor distribution and employment make-up of the politician’s constituency, as well as the politician's personal ideology.  I find empirical support for my hypothesis that, all else equal, a politician within two years of an election is less likely to vote in favor of trade liberalization. 

在本文中，我采用了政治经济周期的框架，以获得关于国际贸易政策的政治家决策模型。为了测试我的模型，我用概率回归分析了一个包含从1993年至2011年间，十八次美国参议院就贸易自由化的表决的独特数据集。我的概率回归测试了以下几个方面：即将到来的再次选举对于现任政治家的贸易政策选择的影响，对于控制资本劳动分配和选区内就业组成的影响，以及对于政治家个人的意识形态的影响。我发现了实验证据来证明我这个假设：在一切平等的情况下，一位在两年内即将参与再选举的政治家不太可能就贸易自由化投赞成票。"
Digital technologies such as the mobile phone, the Internet, and personal computers gained widespread adoption over the past 20 year especially in post-industrial societies gearing up towards production in a knowledge-based economy. However, how have individuals use such advances in technology to control their time better, and increase the value of their time? That is the central question of this Independent Study. With temporal welfare providing a grounding concept as to why societies should care about how individuals allocate their limited resource of time, the paper also questions the ideological backdrop of capitalism, globalization, and neoliberalization that have allowed the rise of digital technologies in our lives. Through understanding the choices individuals make using digital technologies through a neo-classical economic framework, a Marxist economic framework, and a sociological Habitus framework, this paper is armed to tease out the complications of digital technologies as a subject matter. Finally, through the use of the U.K. Workplace Employee Survey data, an econometric analysis was performed to plot the changes in the attitudinal characteristics of workers across three technological transitions. This paper found that workers in the U.K. are working less hours in 2011 than in 1998, knowledge workers work fewer hours than non-knowledge workers. Also, digital technologies can account for some of the variance of various attitudinal feelings about work pace and control over work performed across the three technological transitions, but there are larger factors at play that have aligned workers overall feelings towards the pace of work and control over work done prior to the digital age.
"Abstract
Keysar et al. (2012) and A. Costa et al. (2014) found that thinking in a foreign language could help the speakers to reduce the framing effect and select risky prospects in a more consistent manner. In order to understand the relationships between the risk preferences, consistency in decision-making and language used, an experiment was carried out in form of online surveys. The surveys were distributed to the Vietnamese, Chinese and French bilinguals as well as a group of English natives through The College of Wooster’s e-mail, social media and Amazon M-Turk. Participants (N = 177) were assigned to use either their mother tongue or foreign language to answered either the gain-framed or loss-framed Asian Disease problem. All participants also completed the Holt-Laury’s Ten-Paired-Lottery problem. The data were analyzed by SPSS two-variable Chi-Square and logit regression. The results did not find consistent evidence supporting the effect of foreign-language on the framing effect and risk preferences over all as hypothesized. However, the foreign languages with high linguistic distance were likely to induce framing-effect-reduction and make the decisions more consistent."
"<strong>Overview</strong>
This independent study is divided into two separate<strong> </strong>works. The first focuses on the importance of a small retail business’s location when determining where to site its operations. Through an economic utility framework, academic research identifies ten neighborhood amenities that indicate and support a physical location’s ability to attract and retain residents; individuals who may ultimately define the business’s target market population and support the likelihood of the venture’s profitability. 
The second work applies the findings of the previous section to construct a professional business plan for Deerhaus Decor LLC, a furniture and home decor boutique I intend to launch post-graduation. In addition, primary market research is conducted to verify the suitability of the small retail business’s location in an urban Cincinnati neighborhood experiencing revitalization. The business plan applies questionnaire findings to provide a more cohesive vision for the business, helping better construct the roadmap of its operations while answering the optimal amount of questions regarding the business’s structure."
U.S. policymakers often worry the American public will support military operations only if the human costs of armed conflict or war are minimal. This study will examine whether a specific form of presidential priming (‘rally-around-the-flag’ priming or ‘investment’ priming) is an effective tool for the President of the United States to minimize the constraints public opinion may place on a foreign policy initiative of the administration This study examines the direct impact of presidential priming on public opinion for the Iraq War, and is accomplished through the combination of content analysis of President George W. Bush’s the 2003 to 2008 weekly radio addresses to the nation, Gallup polls accounting for public opinion of the nation in regards to Iraq and a survey experiment. The research findings suggest that ‘rally-around-the-flag’ priming may be an effective form of priming; it remains undetermined whether ‘investment’ priming is an effective form of priming. Furthermore, the data suggest that priming may not overall be as effective at modifying public opinion as previously thought.
Opioid abuse continues to be an increasing problem in the United States. The recent epidemic is in direct proportion to the ever-increasing millions of Americans who suffer from pain. Twenty three states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia currently have medical marijuana laws. My theory suggests that there is a high potential for substitution of opiates to marijuana as legalization continues to take place. I tested treatment admissions for a variety of drugs in every state between 2010-2013 based on how many years they have had an MML and on various demographic variables. My goal was to analyze and determine whether there is evidence of substitution from painkillers, simultaneous diminishing of other drug abuse, or if marijuana was more likely to be a gateway to make opioid, and other drug abuse, worse. The results largely depended on demographics and I found that women, older men and women, and white men and women are more likely to struggle with increases in treatment admissions when marijuana is legalized. The results do, however, suggest that substitution does take place in relation to other drugs. Since the earliest law was enacted only twenty years ago, I suggest continued analysis for more conclusive results.
This Independent Study examines the relationship between political and security governance and state failure. Using a comparative case study methodology, it analyzes three cases: Somalia and the Sudan, two states that top the Fragile State Index’s “very high alert” category every year for instability, and Algeria, a state that is doing comparatively well and enjoying relative stability. Both functionalist and neofunctionalist theories are used to frame the phenomenon of state failure and explain how and why it can happen. These theories better explain the role of human agency and leadership in state failure. The hypothesis that poor political and security governance explains state failure is supported in both Sudan and Somalia, but not in Algeria, most likely due to the extreme centralization in the latter case. It is the hope that this Independent Study will serve to shed some light on the phenomenon of state failure and encourage future research on the matter.
"The 1969 Stonewall Riots marked the beginning of the modern lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) activist movement, and since then, the community has become increasingly visible. However, there is currently a severe lack of concrete demographic information on this population, making it difficult for researchers and activists to understand it and evaluate its needs. One key area in which research is lacking is that of poverty and socioeconomic class. This study, then, was conducted in an attempt to help fill this gap of knowledge, specifically in regards to sexual identity (i.e., LGB people), to determine whether there was a significant difference in food security status between households headed by same-sex couples and those headed by heterosexual couples. I hypothesized that, due to the effect of sexual orientation discrimination on one’s choice-making capability, queer individuals would be more likely to be food insecure. This was then tested using a feminist econometric model and data from the 2014 Current Population Survey’s Food Security Supplement.
However, the results of this model directly contradicted the theory, and showed that queer people were actually less likely to be food insecure. Analyzing these results led me to the conclusion that the theory was sound, but it was the data which was inadequate, due to the subjectivity of self-identification and the relative social privilege required for individuals to have the capability to choose to come out, both of which contribute to the difficulty of creating a quantitative measure of sexual identity. This thesis, then, argues that before large-scale studies on the LGB community can even be conducted, data techniques must be improved so that an accurate and representative sample of queer people in a society can be obtained. From there, researchers and activists can move forward with this important work so that the needs of the LGB community can be assessed, thus allowing them to work towards rights, recognition, and equality."
This paper examines the impact of price, income, health insurance, and education on the uptake of the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine “Gardasil” developed by Merck in 2008. The paper explores the relevant economic theory, particularly Grossman’s model for demand of health capital, and reviews literature of HPV vaccine uptake and cost effectiveness analysis. Using U.S. state average data from the CDC and U.S. Census Bureau 2010-2014, my panel data regression model tries to show how price, income, health insurance, and educational attainment impact HPV uptake rates. My hypothesis is that HPV vaccine price, the level of family income, health insurance and education should raise HPV vaccine uptake on the state average level. My results show a significant unexpected positive correlation between price and uptake, which may be due to limits of using national average price data. This result may show a raise in HPV vaccine demand over time. No significant evidence of correlation was found for income, health insurance, or education in my analysis.
The purpose of this study is to further understand whether or not the war loan drives that were conducted during World War II did in fact alter bond buying behavior for consumers.  The hypothesis of the study is as follows: the use of war loan drives and incentives played a role in increasing the purchasing of war bonds.  A historical analysis was conducted on the implementation of the World War II war loan drive program and the propaganda that was released as a result.  I then compared the motivations that American’s had for purchasing bonds to the themes presented in the propaganda.  As a result of this comparison, I discovered that American’s cited many of the same motivations used in the propaganda as their reasons for purchase bonds.  Using a theory of social preferences and incentives developed by Samuel Bowles and Sandra Polania-Reyes, an empirical analysis was conducted on public opinion data spanning from 1943 to 1944.  This data consisted of the different control variables gender, race, size of area population, and occupation and the bond buying habits of participants.  Based on the analysis it was discovered that there was a statistically significant relationship in the negative direction between the war loan drives and the bond buying behavior of participants.
The main topic of this paper looks at CEOs that have obtained a liberal arts degree. While past literature observes the quality of education obtained by a CEO, this paper differentiates by testing the difference in type of skills developed by a CEO through a liberal arts education. By doing so, two different theories are tested for significance. The first hypothesis states that CEOs with a liberal arts degree will have a positive effect on firm performance. Multiple OLS models are used to test for different measures of performance as well as other variable measurements. Observations come from 145 different firms pulled from the New York Stock Exchange. Initial results are reported insignificant but lead to the discussion on how further testing may yield different results. The second hypothesis looks at what types of firms tend to have a CEO with a liberal arts degree. In particular, theory developed states that more complex firms will have CEOs with a liberal arts degree. Using the same firms observed in the first regressions, a Probit model is run test for different types of firms. Again, most results are reported insignificant but lead to discussion on further research.
The European Union has long been studied as the culmination of an effort to create a more peaceful European continent. A focus on regional political and economic integration has led to a robust EU literature, including, more recently, scholarly exploration of EU foreign policy. Despite this, few scholars have engaged with the idea of the EU acting as an external peace actor. Bridging the literatures of EU foreign policy and peace studies, this project seeks to answer the following research question: has the development of the EU’s foreign policy framework impacted the ways in which the EU engages in building peace externally? The first stage of the project analyzes the peace orientations found in the EU’s formative treaties. The second stage presents an analysis of the mandates for the EU’s peace operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in order to determine the types of peace tools each operation employs. The study hypothesizes that the peace tools employed in EU peace operations will correspond to the peace orientations found in the organization’s key treaties. The findings of the study suggest that the peace orientations and peace tools are varied and the link between the two is inconclusive due to methodological difficulties. Finally, the study concludes that significant analytical value exists in research that combines elements of the EU foreign policy literature and peace studies. Building out of this apparent analytical value, the study contends that future research should continue developing new ways to explore the EU and the peace implications of its behavior.
The scale of movement of students going overseas to seek higher education has increased dramatically in the past several decades. According to the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), there were 4.1 million students pursuing tertiary level studies abroad in 2013. Despite the numerical significance, international students remain to be an under-studied group in migration studies. Thus this study largely draws from the international South-North labor migration debate, which revolves around whether this phenomenon is good (brain gain) or bad (brain drain) for the home countries. Using a comparative case study approach, this study investigates how the governments of the home or source countries can utilize international student mobility as a tool for national development by providing professional incentives to lure students abroad to return home after completing their studies overseas. This study emphasizes the important role of government-provided professional incentives in increasing the likelihood of students to return after the completion of their studies which could lead to the economic growth of their home countries. The study concludes that the home country can experience economic growth despite the failure of government-provided incentives to entice students to return after completing their student overseas. At the same time, it also suggests that the absence of government-provided incentives is detrimental to the economic growth of the home country because it leads to a shortage in human capital as students fail to return to their home countries.
The purpose of this research is to explore and explain the link between obesity and wages. Obesity may lower wages due to three theories. The first is that being obese may lower ones health capital, in turn lowering human capital and finally lowering wages. The second is that obese workers are being discriminated against in the workplace. The final reason I will discuss is that obese workers increase the insurance costs of firms, and these firms then transfer these costs to the obese workers in the form of lower wages. I will test these theories using regression analysis utilizing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. My findings indicate that insurance does not play a large role in the reduction of wages, therefore the wage gap is either due to discrimination or lower productivity.
In developing societies, in the absence of formal insurance markets, when a household faces a catastrophic financial shock, are they left completely on their own? In this Independent Study thesis, I argue that these households have an informal insurance arrangement amongst themselves in which "current generosity is justified by future reciprocity" (Coate & Ravallion, 1993). Assuming that the income endowments of the households follow a memoryless stochastic Markov process, I argue that a risky environment where a financial catastrophe is always around the corner for any household makes these households continue to participate in this income-sharing arrangement. Developing a model of informal insurance using Markov chains and running a numerical simulation, I show that the stability of such an arrangement dependent only on the extent to which the present generation values the future alongside their degree of risk aversion and the severity of a possible catastrophe.
Previous studies have demonstrated that refugee presence makes host states more likely to experience conflicts. Although some refugees migrate with arms, combatants, and ideologies conducive to conflict, the vast majority almost never engage in violence. Their presence; however, impacts the economy and alters previously established social contracts, consequently making local groups more likely to engage in violence. The impact of a refugee population on a host economy; however, is conditional. While the factors that make refugees an asset in one country and a burden in another have a significant impact on the spread of conflict, they still remain undiscovered in the literature. I argue that domestic policies that inhibit refugee economic integration, through restricting freedom of movement and ability to sustain a livelihood, have a negative impact on the economy and make a host community more likely to engage in violent conflicts. To examine the relationship between policies related movement and employment on conflict spillover, I conduct a large N statistical analysis using data that covers 198 instances between 2005 and 2009. I find that freedom of movement is a significant factor in the relationship.
East Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998 was catastrophic for many affected countries. Past studies (e.g. Greenspan (1998), Radelet & Sachs (2000)) had presented the cause of the crisis, which had a common ground that there was a loss of confidence by investors in affected Asian countries which led to increase of perceived risk and increased interest rates of Asian assets. Past studies, however, did not address exactly why investors lose confidence on Asian assets. Using two-period model of consumption-savings decision; firm’s balance sheet cost-benefit analysis; and risk and uncertainty model, the current study examines the impact of poor corporate governance and expected exchange rate on the perceived risk in investing in Asian assets which is embodied in the interest rate spread between firms’ commercial paper and United States Treasury Bill (paper-bill spread). The regression analyses using firm-level data in Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand showed some evidence that corporate governance has significant impact on paper-bill spread.
This paper analyzes the impact of three different types of professional sports franchises on wages in certain economic sectors in 37 cities across the United States. A multitude of other studies have been done around similar areas, however I focus on the Service and Retail sector wages as they are generally low wage jobs. I find a significant positive impact on overall and Services wages by a MLB franchise and a significant positive impact on Services wages by a NBA franchise. However, a NFL franchise is shown to have no significant impact either positive or negative. This study helps to add to the limited amount of studies regarding economic impact of sports franchises. 
The rise of China is a hot topic in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. What does this rising superpower want to pursue, reflected by its grand strategy, has different implications to the international system in the new millennium. After the death of China’s Chairman Mao, China’s foreign policy follows a doctrine highlighted by its then de facto leader Deng Xiaoping, that insisted China should hide its ambitions and refrain from asserting its power in the global stage. This study seeks to find out whether China has experienced a grand strategy shift in the past ten years, and if yes, what are its driving forces. Existing literature on great power politics, in particular hegemonic stability theory and structural realism, provides different arguments on state behavior and its implications on China’s grand strategy. Based on the literature, this study provides three competing hypotheses and tests them with on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Based on a thorough time series analysis between 2005 and 2014, as well as arguments supported by scholars in the field, this study suggests that China has indeed experienced a grand strategy shift. China’s need for security and safety, and a global environment that favors its existence are the driving forces for its grand strategy shift. China’s new grand strategy requires it to be more assertive and more engaging in the global arena by actively build up strategic partnerships and engage in international institutions. 
This thesis analyzes the effect of technical expenditures on the demand for labor in the oil and gas extraction industry. This analysis was done using a fixed-effect regression model. The findings suggest that increases in technological expenditures have an adverse effect on wages for laborers employed within the industry. The broader implications are increased technologies expenditures increase the wages for employees of higher skill, but negatively affect wages of those with lesser human capital stock.
"Why does the deadlock that has defined China-Taiwan relations for 65 years persist despite periods of extreme tension and change? I use the Model of Punctuated Equilibrium from evolutionary biology as a framework to answer this question. The PE Model is comprised of two parts, positive and negative feedback. A positive feedback mechanism, or punctuation, is a self-reinforcing process in which rapid change occurs as a result of attention-shift and mimicking. A negative feedback cycle, or equilibrium, is a self-correcting mechanism, which equalizes any outside force to create a stable output. According to this model, if China and Taiwan increase their disruptive actions, then the United States will increase its influence to promote stability, resulting in a lower level of conflict. To test my hypothesis, I implement a theory-guided case study. My first case encompasses the positive feedback cycle formed by the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crises. The second case discusses the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis and the 1999 Taiwan Strait Confrontation. The goal of this study is to explore the rise of conflict in the Taiwan Strait and the resultant level of negative feedback that stabilizes the situation until the political deadlock is reinstated.
为什么在这六十五年来,中国和台湾的关系还在弄僵? 我用进化生物学的 Model of Punctuated Equilibrium 来回答这个问题。这 PE Model 由两部分做成:正反馈 和负反馈。这反馈是一个换得快的过程。这个过程要经过注意力转移和模仿。 负反馈 是一个自动教程的机制。 这个机制均衡任何外力来创造一个稳定的输出。按照这个模 型,如果中国和台湾增加他们的破坏性等,美国就会增加他的影响力和提高稳定性, 导致减少他们冲突。 为了测试我的假设我实现了一个理论制造的个案研究。 我的第一 个案例包含了台湾第一和第二次台海危机。 我的第二个案例讨论了第三次台海危机和 1999 年台湾海峡对峙。我的研究目的是来了解台海的冲突和重建台湾和中国的关系。"
How does the public perceive governmental foreign policy, and how do these perceptions change? By examining newspaper coverage of military interventions in Latin America, this paper analyzes media attitudes towards US-Latin American policy over time. It compares governmental reasoning for intervention to the reasoning, and critiques of reasoning, found in the coverage. The author utilizes 1927 Nicaraguan Intervention, 1965 Dominican Republic Intervention, and Operation Just Cause as data and identifies two contrasting trends within coverage over time. First is a willingness to deviate from government-sourced narratives concerning foreign policy decisions. This trend remains static through the Dominican Republic intervention before radically altering itself during Operation Just Cause. The second is an increased understanding of historical foreign policy and the importance of historical context. This trend intensifies as the 20<sup>th</sup> century progresses. These two trends combined suggest an increased concern with US foreign policy and its designs for Latin America specifically, in coordination with a decreased trust in government-sourced narratives. 
In this thesis, I present research in the fields of economics and history. I address both the current issue of non-profit hospital behavior surrounding charitable donations, and provide a recent historical perspective of the structure of hospital community benefits that has resulted from the regulatory environment the United States enacted in response to the shifting social paradigms of American healthcare. It is generally understood that non-profit hospitals provide a broad level of community benefits not received from for-profit hospitals. Further, altruistic donations to non-profit hospitals are considered necessary so they can provide charity care for the community’s most needy. This study attempts to investigate the destruction of traditional non-profit hospital tendencies, away from a purely charitable service, and towards one that is operated with profit seeking tendencies. I hypothesize that non-profit hospitals with a greater level of oversight by altruistic donors will spend less on expenditures that produce no value for the institution. I test this hypothesis empirically using a regression model that employs data of 20 hospitals spanning the fiscal years 2008 through 2012. The result of my analysis provides significant evidence in support of my economic hypothesis. Along with my historical argument, my study provides additional understanding of the way non- profit hospitals are run. This thesis is not meant as a policy suggestion, though it continues to add to the limited literature surrounding charitable donations in the non-profit healthcare sector.
This project analyzes the relationship between gift exchange and music consumption. Relationships in gift exchange are characterized through increasing rates of cyclical reciprocation over time. By actively participating in the gift exchange of music, preferences of music are believed to increase over time. The literature explores a wide variety of gift interpretations, incentives for active reciprocation, and how the inherently subjective value of music impacts willingness to pay. When juxtaposing social and economic theory, it is found that through the inclusion of social welfare, contrary to economic rationality, heightens levels of optimization. When the gift is understood as an economic incentive of pro-social behavior, the social context of the gift is what determines behavior and not the gift itself. Data were collected by distributing surveys to College of Wooster students asking them of their musical preferences respond to different contexts of music consumption. Although the effect of the gift could not be proved as a statistically significant indicator in changing behavior and welfare, qualitative analysis of written responses in the survey proved the effect of the theories for a limited population. This research could have been improved by considering the musical gift exchange in consumer-to-consumer relationships as opposed to this study’s focus on the artist-to-consumer relationship.
This project addresses the research question: how do nationalist leaders affect the levels of support for their self-determination movements? A review of the literature identified that this question has not been properly studied; therefore, in an effort to address this question, this study turns to charismatic leadership in order to close this large gap in the literature. The main hypothesis of this study is that if nationalist leaders are charismatic, then the leaders will be more likely to increase the levels of support for their self-determination movements. Charismatic leadership is regarded as the result of the combination of the following traits/skills: (1) visionary, (2) communicative, (3) trustworthy, (4) impression management. Two nationalist movement leaders from Catalonia were chosen for this study: (1) Jose Montilla, and (2) Artur Mas. According to this research, charismatic leadership has an effect on the levels of support for self-determination movements; however, these findings are inconclusive because of methodological difficulties. Changes need to be made and further experiments should be conducted to come to conclusive results.
During the 1980’s, India experienced a sudden decline in its Balance of Payments (BOP), which led the country to increase its national debt. The growing fiscal debt led to a decline in foreign investments in India, as the country was soon on the brink of a financial crisis. India experienced a severe depreciation during the 1991 financial crisis. Our study examines China’s foreign exchange intervention during the period 1980-2000, as we suspect that the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) currency manipulation coupled with the growing fiscal debt triggered the 1991 financial crisis. In our study we hypothesize that China’s currency manipulation had a negative effect on India’s BOP. In order to examine the BOP, we individualize the effect on the Capital and Current account. According to theory, the BOP should always equal zero, however, we are analyzing the Current and Capital account portions of the BOP, without taking into account the official reserves settlement account that balances out any surplus or deficit. We derive the Mundell-Fleming IS-LM model in order to theorize China’s currency manipulation. The five empirical articles that we analyze and evaluate help us derive our conceptual and operational model. Since we utilize a time series data set, we test for unit roots, and other tests such as multicollinearity, serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. The results of our empirical testing indicate that China’s currency manipulation had a significant effect on India’s Capital account only. Therefore, we prove our hypothesis, but with weak results.
Recently, there have been several initiatives to address corruption at the international level. However, there have been signals at the state level to suggest that corruption is negatively impacting the United States. While technological advancements have increased production levels, hourly wages have remained stagnant. It is crucial that we better understand corruption at the state level because it is associated with slow economic growth. This paper aims to investigate if evidence in support of the following hypothesis can be found: among the fifty United States, governments that show higher levels of corruption will tend to exhibit lower levels of yearly GDP per capita. This paper extends the previous literature done on the topic by using relevant theoretical models to construct a conceptual regression model that describes the relationship between political corruption and growth at the state level. I will specifically make use of three economic models to support my hypothesis: a theory on Bureaucratic Behavior, Rent-Seeking Behavior, and the Solow Growth Model. Given this theoretical approach and previous significant research done on the topic, I will then construct my own conceptual regression model to test for my proposed hypothesis. The results of this study find significant decrease in GDP per capita, a reduction educational attainment, and an increase in unemployment rate amongst other variables. My results suggest that corruption should be addressed at the state level to better encourage economic prosperity in the United States.
There are many ways of explaining what determines the human cost of civil wars, but little attention has focused on the relationship between religion and its dynamics and the human cost of civil wars. Religion is a powerful motivator and a large portion of the human population adheres to one of the world’s many religions. Consequently, it is important to understand how religion affects armed conflicts within states, one of the most common forms of large scale conflict in the world. Using a case study approach, this study examines civil wars in Algeria, the Philippines, Angola, and Peru, to test whether religious civil wars are costlier than non-religious civil wars in terms of human lives lost. Contrary to prior quantitative research, this study’s findings suggest that religious civil wars are not more costly than non-religious civil wars. However, there is some evidence that higher levels of religious outbidding correlate to higher cost levels. Future research should seek to examine more cases of religious civil wars qualitatively, to better understand the extent to which religion is a determinant of the human cost of civil wars.
This research examined the effect of parental leave policies and socio-economic factors on labor force participation in 29 OECD countries, with a focus on the United States, Germany, and Turkey. The aim of the study was to determine how various aspects of policy and demographic factors impact parents’ choice to remain or exit the labor market. Through an interdisciplinary analysis of economic and feminist theory and literature, this study found mixed results. The results of regression analysis did not support the hypotheses; however, several lessons about intersectional research were revealed. Mainly, the need for comprehensive parental leave policies is not necessarily justified through purely statistical research. The complexities of human and social identity transcend quantitative analysis.
"Following more than 40 years of conflict, the Colombian state has been moved down the list of priorities in the United States’ war on drugs. The United States provided the Colombian government with support for anti-narcotic initiatives, with some in part meant to combat the social and political opposition formed by the Colombian leftist-guerilla groups, and the Colombian cartels. The analysis of the war on drugs was broken down into three chapters, which together are meant to tell the narrative of the war on drugs in Colombia and the resulting fall out that has followed major policy shifts in Colombia. From the three differing perspectives, along with their own involvement and action in the war, it is clear that United States policy in Colombia failed to eliminate the production of narcotics. The policies did manage to produce unintended consequences, a militarization of Colombia’s response to issues, and a policy of going after individuals instead of operations. The war on drugs in Colombia was a policy failure, and the United States struggled to adapt to an industry manned by many of the actors locked in the same conflict. The implication of these outcomes is a greater understanding of just how complicated the situation in Colombia was, and how difficult it can be to produce results.

This study seeks to identify if internalized negative racial and ethnic stereotypes impact U.S. public support for Syrian refugee relocation. Related literature was reviewed to develop the two hypotheses for this study: the more one has internalized negative racial and ethnic stereotypes of refugees, the less supportive they will be towards refugee relocation, and that internalized stereotypes will be more influential than other economic or ideological factors. These hypotheses were tested through a survey using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, and then analyzed with ordered logit regression. The results of this study indicated that positive traits associated with Syrian refugees led to higher support for relocation, while negative traits resulted in decreased support. These results prove the first hypothesis of this study to be true; however, the second hypothesis was not proven due to limited statistical analysis. Influenced by the findings of this study, policy recommendations and potential implications to reduce the use of stereotypes in public discourse on refugees were made.
"Supporters believe that the emergence of charter schools can provide disenfranchised students with profound academic opportunities. Critics believe that the market-oriented school choice system will aggravate inequalities. The purpose of the paper is to examine the locational decisions of charter schools in the city of Chicago, Illinois. I utilize an ordered probit and the marginal effects analysis to estimate the need-based, market creaming, and political-institutional models. Some findings are consistent with the belief that charter schools detain from locating in areas with larger percentages of minorities, which causes an increases in segregation while other finding support the response charter schools have with competing surrounding schools; in conclusion, I found that the supporters and critics do not evaluate the complexity of charter school location and that the location pattern appears more sensitive to the characteristics of the area. <strong></strong>

This study examines the effect of government-provided education benefits on military enlistment and reenlistment during the global war on terror.  Conceptually, education benefits are viewed as a form of military compensation and a way to cover the direct costs associated with a college degree.  Because a college degree increases the earnings one can receive in the civilian sector, education benefits are expected to increase the utility of both the military and the civilian sector.  The hypothesis is that education benefits lead to an increase in the likelihood of enlistment and a decrease in the likelihood of reenlistment.  According to past literature, this relationship holds, but is outdated.  This study seeks to update these results and make them generalizable to the global war on terror and the Post-9/11 GI Bill.  It does so by testing the hypotheses using fixed effects regressions on annual state recruitment and retention levels.  In addition, the models are estimated for the Montgomery GI Bill and the Post-9/11 GI Bill to distinguish between the effects of different programs.  The results indicate that education benefits have no significant effect on recruitment and a positive effect on retention, or the level of personnel.  The Montgomery GI Bill had the greatest impact with an increase in retention per 1,000 population 18-30 years of age by 11.44 personnel, while the Post-9/11 GI Bill had no significant impact. 
This paper identifies a considerable gap in the literature that studies living wage policy. The field of living wage research is relatively small, as the topic is fairly new. There is little consensus between economists on the complete effects that a living wage policy has on a given labor market. This might be a construct of the wide variety of testing methods and model specifications that are used in the research process. However, most studies fail to recognize the spatial implications of the policy. The introduction of a living wage must be studied in a way that addresses the change in the composition of the metropolitan labor market. Since living wage policies have been implemented only in large metropolitan cities thus far, it should be studied in a manner that observes the differences between neighboring labor markets, rather than aggregating data from the entire geographic location. The model presented in this paper includes several independent variables to evaluate the spatial effects that a living wage policy has when estimating income and employment.
For the last few decades, women have played a greater role in terrorism. Yet Western news and popular media outlets constantly frame terrorism as a male-controlled domain and that women simply do not fit the “terrorist profile”. When a woman does commit an act of terror, the media manipulates gender images and stereotypes in order to explain her violent behavior. While scholars acknowledge that such gendered narratives distort reality, none have systematically analyzed the effects such messaging techniques have on public perception. For that reason, this study aims to understand how gendered messaging strategies affect individuals’ attitudes towards perceived threat of female terrorists. As such, I tested the efficacy of gendered media messaging by using an experimental research design in which respondents were randomly assigned to one of six treatment groups and shown a short news article with a basic, feminized, or “beautified” frame that recounted an event of a fictitious terrorist attack. After completing the survey, respondents were asked questions regarding their perceptions of threat and willingness to punish the perpetrator. The results of this study illustrate that amplified narratives, containing gendered language with details of the female terrorist’s physical characteristics, are the most effective at provoking higher levels of threat as opposed to a male terrorist committing an identical crime.
Are World Heritage Sites being created for the protection of their cultural heritage or are they being created to meet short term political and economic goals? This study explores the politics behind World Heritage Site inscription and the subsequent increase in personal tourism arrivals by utilizing political theory, economic theory, and regression analysis. The political theory discusses the political economy of World Heritage Site nomination through the theories of International Political Economy, balance of power, and multilateralism. The economic theory explores the economic effects of a World Heritage Site through externalities and supply demand shifts. Lastly, the regression analysis evaluates the impact of World Heritage Sites on personal tourism arrivals and personal tourism expenditure using panel data with a sample of 58 states from 2011-2015. My findings suggest UNESCO World Heritage Sites do not significantly affect personal tourism expenditure, but do significantly increase personal tourism arrivals.
The purpose of this research is to determine the effect playing a sport at the College of Wooster has on an individual’s success in the job market. I hypothesize that due to a higher level of productivity, student-athletes at the College of Wooster have greater success in the job market compared to non-student athletes. After surveying over 600 College of Wooster alumni, I use an OLS regression to test the effect playing a sport has on an individual’s first and current salary, as well as the length it took the individual to obtain employment. The findings show that student-athletes earn a higher salary than non-student-athletes; yet the results regarding the time it took to find employment were insignificant. 
Despite the vast research done and prominent media representation of post-World War II Germany, the surface is just being scratched in regards to the discussion of Germany’s shifting political, economic, and social climates as a result of the Syrian refugee crisis. The relationship between Germany and the Syrian refugee crisis is internationally known, however it is often portrayed as an unsolvable humanitarian crisis that needs attention. Correspondingly, Germany and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, are depicted as brave, philanthropic actors of aid as they welcomed millions of Syrians into their country. Through literature and news sources discussing chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany’s stance on multiculturalism, the causes and consequences of the Syrian refugee crisis, and the definitions of German Heimat and home, the social, political, and humanitarian histories of these topics led to ideas and explanations of the current state of Germany and the people living there. As a result of the influx of Syrians into Germany, there has been a sense of soul searching and a pursuit for home, as the face of Germany has proven to be fluid. Researching this relationship that links Germany and the Syrian refugee crisis has led to a creation of ideas about how the Syrian refugees living in Germany has ultimately created a national confusion of identity and sense of home, while Syrians are acclimating, integrating, and finding their own sense of home. It is clear that there are gaps in literature researching and discussing these findings and it is essential, as the world moves forward, to create the discussion and academic representation of Germany’s relationship with the Syrian refugee crisis and the effects of this relationship on Germany and Syrians, predominately focusing on German society and national identity today.  <strong></strong>
The emphasis on human capital formation as a means to achieve increased productivity and economic growth lead many countries to develop immigration policies that favored skilled worker migration from less developed countries. In the recent decades, the increased demand from developed countries for high-skilled labor caused a surge in the rate of high-skill emigration. The increased circulation of skilled migrants from less developed to developed countries brings about many complex economic implications for both sending and host countries. Drawing from brain drain literature that focuses on emigration prospects and human capital formation in sending countries, this paper develops a game theoretic model that looks at the strategic interaction between prospective emigrants and the home country. Congruent with literature, theoretical results show that better emigration prospects induce investment in education in native workers, which under certain circumstances can lead to human capital accumulation in the developing country.
Human-induced climate change is affecting global climate in unprecedented ways. As the global temperature rises, there are sure to be numerous effects on the world’s systems, both natural and unnatural. Many researchers and policymakers have tried to identify links between climate change and how they affect political stability. This I.S. attempts to add to this body of literature by analyzing three cases from the West African Sahel region. After conducting qualitative case studies of Senegal, Burkina Faso and Mali, this I.S. concludes that a potential, direct link exists between environmental degradation caused by climate change and state insecurity.

In this research study, I evaluate social capital’s impacts on GDP and HDI and the influence of noteworthy intra-state conflicts on social capital’s impacts on the two. I use Fehr and Schmidt’s (1999) utility model based on social preferences to theoretically demonstrate that without intra-state conflicts social capital positively impacts GDP and HDI and that noteworthy intra-state conflicts diminish these positive impacts of social capital on GDP and HDI that state governments, markets, and civil society organizations as social capital mechanisms can facilitate in at least two cases: public goods contributions and investment. I then empirically evaluate four variable hypotheses by using macro-economic data on 144 countries in 2010 to conduct cross-sectional empirical analysis<a title="""">[1]</a>. The findings of the analysis unfortunately fail to confirm the validity of these four variable hypotheses. However, they do suggest that future research on political and economic policies involving noteworthy intra-state conflicts, unemployment rates, intellectual property laws and norms, and internet infrastructure in terms of their own impacts on GDP and HDI is greatly warranted.

Au moyen de cette étude de recherche, j’évalue les effets de la capitale sociale sur le PIB et sur l’IDH et celui des conflits intraétatiques notables sur ces effets de la capitale sociale sur les deux. J’adopte le modèle d’utilité basé sur les préférences sociales élaboré par Fehr and Schmidt (1999) et démontre d’une façon théorétique que sans conflits intraétatiques, la capitale sociale a des effets positifs sur le PIB et sur l’IDH que les gouvernements étatiques, les marchées, et les organisations de la société civile comme quelques mécanismes de la capitale sociale peuvent encourager dans deux cas, par les contributions aux biens publics et par l’investissement, au moins. Ensuite, j’évalue quatre hypothèses d’une façon empirique en compilant les données macro-économiques aux 144 pays en 2010 pour faire la conduite d’analyses empiriques et transversales. Les résultats de cette étude de recherche ne réussissent pas à vérifier leur validité. Cependant, ils suggèrent qu’il soit très utile de faire la recherche future sur les stratégies politiques et sur les politiques économiques en ce qui concerne les effets des conflits intraétatiques notables eux-mêmes, des taux de chômage, de la propriété intellectuelle et de ses normes, et de l’infrastructure l’Internet sur le PIB et sur l’IDH.

The purpose of this study is to test the effects of innovative entrepreneurship on urban economic performance. This paper develops a theoretical model using an urban production function and agglomeration economy model framework. The urban production model is an expansion of a neoclassical production function that presents urban output as a function of labor and capital and also as a function of agglomerative factors and technology. These agglomerative factors present characteristics that promote innovation within urban areas.
Two empirical models were created using , the first of which tests the factors that influence the presence of small firms based on characteristics of metropolitan areas that promote innovation. The second empirical was developed to determine the effects the presence of small firms have on metropolitan economic performance. In a sequential framework, the findings of this study present evidence that innovation and dynamic agglomeration contribute to the viability of urban areas.

Beginning with the definition of key terms and concepts of international relations- based on the relationships between the world’s religions, ethnicity, nationalism, individual and social identity, the perception of threat, power, and national security- I develop a new theoretical approach that provides a synthesis of prior explanations for ethnic conflict and state security. I then test the expectations of this approach on the religious plurality and military expenditures of states for all dyad years from 1960 to 2005. I find strong support for its predictions based on shared religious plurality, the perception of threat, and the directed and joint military expenditures of states. Further, the findings provide insights into the effects of shared religious plurality among sender and target states, as well as the effects of alliance formation, the balance of power, economic interdependence, joint democracy, and interdependence. Thus, this independent study distinguishes the relative importance of both religion as a determining characteristic and pattern of ethnicity, and military expenditure as an explanatory factor of state security, and therefore has broadly interesting implications for the study of international relations.
Esta investigación se trata del nivel alto de la violencia en Latinoamérica hoy en día. La enfoca es en América Central específicamente. La investigación intenta responder a la pregunta: ¿Qué es la causa del aumento dramático en la tasa de homicidios en América Central? La hipótesis de esta investigación propone que el aumento de la implementación de policías consideradas como Mano Dura va a incrementar la tasa de homicidios en América Central. Esta relación se debe a la teoría que un aumento de represión por el gobierno resuelta en el aumento de violencia al nivel de la sociedad. Esto es verdad en el caso de las maras y pandillas de América Central porque represalia por maras y pandillas contra el gobierno es muy común. La investigación utiliza un estudio de casos y usa el método de diferencia por John Stuart Mill. Hay cuatro casos estudiados; (1) El Salvador en 2012, (2) El Salvador en 2015, (3) Honduras en 2012, y (4) Honduras en 2015. Por eso la investigación es transnacional y temporal. El Salvador es el caso con tendencia creciente en su tasa de homicidios y es el caso positivo, y Honduras tiene tendencia creciente en su tasa de homicidios y es el caso negativo. Al fin, no hay evidencia suficiente proporcionada por el análisis para apoyar la hipótesis.

As developed nations alter their immigration policies to attract high-skill workers from abroad, the rate of human capital movement across borders— especially from the developing world—has surged in the recent past. However, increased high-skill emigration has more complex economic implications for a developing country than the obvious brain drain. This paper develops a game theoretic model based on Albert Hirschman’s Exit-Voice-Loyalty (EVL) concept and the Tiebout hypothesis to explain a citizen’s emigration decision. The outcomes of the game are applied to the human capital augmented Solow growth model to explore the effects of emigration on the source country’s economic growth. Theoretical results show that, under certain circumstances outlined by the EVL game, emigration can lead to increased human capital accumulation in a developing country in two ways. First, the prospect of emigration generates extra incentive for individuals to invest in education. Second, return migration triggered by the government’s reaction to foot-voting costs brings technological knowledge from the developed countries.
